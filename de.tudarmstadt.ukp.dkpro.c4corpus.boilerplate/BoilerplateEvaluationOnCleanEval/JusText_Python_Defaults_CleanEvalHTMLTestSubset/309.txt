<p> Welcome to the world's best free car buying guide for buying new cars, used cars, auto leasing and avoiding
scams. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll buy a car. There are copycat sites with similar names who paraphrase our content, but we are the original
and the best. This 100% FREE site is about truth, but few people want you to know the truth on buying cars and SUVs.
<p> Your Host: Jeff Ostroff shows you how to haggle your best fair profit offer on new cars and determining
dealer cost for new autos.
<p> The Way To Save Cash On A Car or SUV Is With Competing Bids
We'll review auto buying sites like Cars.com,
InvoiceDealers,
CarsDirect,
Yahoo!Autos,
Autoweb,
Autos.com,
Edmunds.com and
Car.com to learn what dealers pay for new cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans, and how you can save
the most money. These sites offer you free new car price quotes and new car dealer invoice prices. Competitive automobile quotes helps keep new car dealers in line.
<p> Where to get new car invoice pricing and rebate information
After successfully using consumer advocate tools like the FightingChance New Car Buying Info Package,
our visitors are happy to fill our $avOmeter Database with their savings on their new car. You can get
New Auto Rebate information, secret factory to dealer incentives and new car dealer invoice pricing
from FightingChance. The market sales intelligence they provide for your new car is priceless.
<p> How Bad Is Your Credit?
Before buying a new car, you MUST get your credit report and credit score from Experian,
Equifax or
TrueCredit. Then auto dealers can't lie and say: "You
have bad credit." Most people have black marks that need to be removed before applying for new car loans. Dealers should never know more about your credit than you.
<p> Which New Car Dealer Scams Did You Fall For?Most new car dealers are honest, but there are some who will scam you. Read our annual
Top 10 New Car Dealer Scams.
<p> "This new car is hot, everyone pays MSRP. We don't have to sell it cheaper."A common sales tactic in auto sales. If they have any in stock of your new
car or SUV, then it's not in demand or there would be 6 month waiting lists. If your new car is not "in demand," then you should "demand" less than MSRP for your new
vehicle.
<p> When buying new cars, don't trade in a car you owe money on!
I get complaints from people who traded in a used car they owed money on to buy a new car, and 2 months later were shocked to hear the new car dealer did not pay off
their car loan in 10 days as promised. With this scam dealers pay you less for your trade than they promised. When the bank calls, YOU are responsible. The car
loan is still in your name, until the dealer pays it off. When buying new cars, if you trade a used car in, make the dealer put in writing that he will pay off your
car loan in 10 days, or no deal. Then he is liable.
<p> Early Car Lease Termination Without Penalties? Taking Over a Short Term Lease?
Shift your strategy away from terminating an auto lease early, trading your car and paying huge penalties. A better strategy is transferring your car lease to
another person via an auto lease trade. Sites like Swapalease.comand LeaseTrader.comcan do a car lease swap for you, and reassign your auto lease to another buyer, saving
you thousands. You can also use them to take over a short term lease, where the previous owner already took the big depreciation hit.
<p> Sell Your Used Car Yourself
You can get $3,000 more for your car at online auto classifieds sites: Cars.com and
CarsDirect
<h> Not Every Car Salesperson Is Out To Scam You
<p> We've dealt with many honest new car salespeople. We're here to educate new car buyers and only belittle car dealers who lie and cheat. Most automobile dealers care
about you and will give you a great new car deal. They deserve to profit, they have mortgages, "mouths to feed", and so do you, so haggle a new car deal that is fair
for you and the automobile dealer. Treat them with the same respect that you would expect, and don't lie. Justify your offers in a professional business manner. The
nicest new car dealer can still be a tough seller. Salespeople who complain we are lumping all car salespeople as "sewer rats" misread the word some to mean
all. Don't forget furniture stores, who mark up 400%. With 50% off sales, they still double their money. We had our furniture shipped from wholesalers in the
Carolinas. Read my article How To Buy Home Furniture From Furniture Stores. Jewelers
cheat too. On my site BridalTips.com, read
How To Buy Diamond Engagement Rings And Avoid Scams.

<h> Do's and Don'ts When Buying new cars:
<p> Put deposits on a credit card. Run from automobile dealers who "only take checks."
<h> Angry Emails We Get From New Car Dealers: The Good, The Mad, The Ugly
<p> I get email from new car dealers, some professional, offering disagreement, some give us more info, saying they wish the bad seeds were not ruining it for everyone:
<p> Hi Jeff,
I stumbled onto your website, and you have great information!! I've been in the car business for 12 years 11 of which have been at the same dealership.
I've never heard or seen of some of the things that you say to look out for (credit insurance slipped into leases, hiding trades, etc.). Have
you received e-mail that this goes on (within the last 5 years )? I'd be curious to hear from you about some of these things. Again, congrats
on a well informed web site, and look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Paul Albert, Sales Manager, Bob Sharp Nissan
<p> Nice guy, he knows we're here to help. Then I got this one below, also a Nissan dealer. Big difference in attitude, showing what some new car
dealers think of you. He's from the old school of selling new cars.
<p> Dear Idiot,
I invite you to spend a week in my dealership to see how things really work. Price does not sell cars, the car itself does. If some one really loves a car they will
pay a premium price for that vehicle. And normally they are the happiest of all customers. The goofball who comes in with all of the internet info., consumer reports
printouts, and a chip on their shoulder saying "I WILL NOT GET SCREWED!!!!", are the people that we always have the nagging problems with. The only thing I can say to
you is to get some expirience from the other side before shooting your mouth off, it just makes you look that much less intelligent. Unsincerely yours.
<p> That should be "insincerely yours". I guess he is not a big fan of Cars.com or
InvoiceDealers I thought customer service and not referring to us as "goofballs" sells new cars. Welcome to the new way of selling autos.
<p> Feedback: We used FightingChance.com -- so worth the money! There was a $500 dealer cash
incentive in effect at the time we bought.

I have got to tell you that I absolutely LOVE your website. The messages from certain "Dealers" are priceless. I am a General Manager from a small
family-owned car dealership located in Kansas, and everything you write (or rant) about is exactly what all of us need to hear (Customers and Dealers alike).
<p> The days of over pricing our product and tricking people into making decisions that aren't right for them are over. The true Car "Retailers" are posed to change the
status quo. Thank you for the education you provide "My" customer. Not everyone in this business is scared of you (rather they embrace your perceptions of our
business). Great Job and keep up the good work!!!

<p> DEAR JEFF,
i AM A FINANCE MANAGER AT A VERY LARGE DEALERSHIP. i HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU.
1) DID YOU ASK YOUR BUTCHER TO SELL YOU YOUR STEAK AT HIS COST?
2) HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE FROM SCARING PEOPLE OUT OF GOING TO THIER LOCAL DEALERSHIP?
3) WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT AND TRY TO MAKE A LIVING IN A BUSINESS THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU GIVE A BAD NAME AND MKE MORE MONEY THAN I DO FOR
DOING IT.
<p> NOW JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS. YOU WOULDN'T LAST A DAY ON MY SALES FLOOR. IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT ALL INTERNET SHOPPERS SHOP ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THEY
ARE TO SCARED TO COME NEGOTIATE WITH THE BIG, BAD CAR SALESMAN. AUTOMOBILES ARE THE ONLY PRODUCT IN AMERICA THAT THE PROPRIETOR IS REQUIRED TO LIST THE MSRP ON
THE WINDOW. tHE GALLON OF WATER YOU PAY TWO DOLLARS FOR COSTS THE STORE 19 CENTS. HOW MUCH WATER DID YOU BUY LAST YEAR? PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE THE ONES WHO
GIVE THIS BUSINESS A BAD NAME. AND THATS WHAT IT IS, A BUSINESS. WE ARE HERE TO MAKE MONEY. DO YOU GET UPSET WHEN YOU GO TO A RESTARAUNT ANDPAY FIFTEEN DOLLARS
FOR A STEAK THAT COST THEM THREE? PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE. I HAVE A JOB TO DO, AND LITTLE JERK-OFFS LIKE YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU LEAD
ALL THE OTHER JERK-OFFS WHO HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES.
<p> Someone's grouchy. I like how he says people like ME give the
new car business a bad name. The vehicle market had that stigma before I came around. I'm giving new car buying a good name. We don't scare people out of new car dealers, we send hundreds of confident
new vehicle buyers into dealers through Cars.com
or InvoiceDealers, so he has no clue. Big
difference between a $15 steak and a $25,000 new SUV or car with $1500 of overpriced fabric protection, VIN# etching, "lifetime" wax jobs and alarms.

What do you know about buying cars? well i am a car salesman. you people think you know everything!! selling cars is my profession!!!! that is my living. i
dont scam anyone you people think that you can get the car for free. well you cant(surprise)! let me ask you this,when you go shopping for food do you tell
thecashier that you will give them 50 cents for that 3.00 package of meat?even though there is a 300% mark up margin in you food!i didnt think so!!! you tell
the cust. to go on kelly blue book and see what there trade in is worth. kelly blue book is false!!!(suprise) call kelly blue book ane see if they would buy
your car for that ridiculious price!! i didnt think so. its websites such as this one that give the cust the wrong impression on how to buy a vehicle! please if
you dont know anything about the car buisness dont put garbage up like this S***!!
if thats all you have to do is badmouth the dealership then get a F***ING LIFE!!!!
<p> p.s. I BET YOU WONT POST THIS!!!!!
<p> I cleaned up Mr. Mature's words with a ****. Why is it that whining salespeople complain "I never argue the price at the grocery
store?" I think they all read took same ineffective vehicle sales course. This guy's a real Einstein. Grocery store managers are laughing at him, with his uneducated
claims of 300% profit. Grocers only make 1% to 3% profit. We don't ask grocers to drop the price on an 89 cent can of peas. We use coupons, or buy it at a cheaper
store. When a store sells you a steak, they don't lie about your credit score; force you to buy VIN# etching; or a steak warranty you didn't want. Mr. Autos thinks we
know nothing? That's why our visitors report new car savings of $2000-$3000 after using our automotive buying advice and savings over $4000-$6000 on new SUVs, trucks
and minivans.
<p> Subject: YOUR WEBSITE
<p> COMING FROM A DEALER YOUR WEBSITE IS COMPLETELY FULL OF BULL****. YOU CRY BABY, YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE
OF BY THE BIG BAD CAR DEALER AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE. GROW UP.
<p> I had to clean up Mr. Mature's words with a ****. Would you buy an SUV or minivan from him? He saw I posted his last email:
<p> Subject: HEY YOU F**K FROM THE LOCAL DEALER
<p> BOO HOO BOO HOO, you put my letter on your website, good for you, so you must be proud of yourself for saving everyone so much money.
Why don't you make a site for the local MALL and give them all a hard time for marking up THEIR products?? You won't because people expect to pay a profit to those
stores, why shouldn't they pay a profit for our product?? Because web sites such as yours give the PUBLIC a bad name with car dealers so we can just hate each other
until infinity. The funny thing is, the easy going people who do let us make a profit are the ones that we treasure the most, not all because of money, but instead
because they are nice people and don't expect something for nothing like the losers that enter your site. ALL OF YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY STORE, I HAVE NO INTEREST IN
SELLING YOU A CAR!!
<p> I can imagine his slogan: "We add the "vice" in Service". I mention shopping malls? This is CarBuyingTips.com,
not a site on malls. Automobile dealers complain that we tell you to offer 3% dealer profit, while shopping malls earn 10%. I'd rather own an auto dealership
with 3% of a $25,000 sale than a mall store with 10% of a $4000 sale. You do the math. Many visitors, after seeing his emails, flamed him. After he begged me, I
deleted his auto dealership email address, he couldn't take it anymore.
<p> Subject: YOU POSTED MY LETTER ON YOUR SITE AHOLE
LET YOUR IDIOT INTERNET FREAKS KNOW THAT I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THE CAR BUSINESS. THEY WRITE ME THESE LETTERS THAT ARE SO PATHETIC ABOUT THIS AND THAT AND
THEIR PATHETIC LOSER LIVES. THEY ACTUALLY TAKE TIME OUT OF THEIR DAY TO TELL ME HOW UPSET MY POSTING MAKES THEM. I DON'T GIVE ONE F***ING
IOTA. I WANT TO MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE ON EVERY CAR AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT, TOO BAD. WE ARE THE BIGGEST AND BEST DEALERSHIP WITH THE HIGHEST CUSTOMER
SATISFACTION AND YES WE MAKE MONEY, ALL DAY LONG. SO TELL YOUR RETARDED INTERNET F*** HEADS THAT IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT THEY CAN SUCK IT.
EVERY EMAIL I GET IS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE THAT REMINDS ME OF FORREST GUMP. STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES YOU IDIOTS. LEAVE ME ALONE, AND IF I RESPOND TO YOU DON'T BE SUCH A
PUSSY, WRITE ME BACK, BUT OF COURSE THEY NEVER DO BECAUSE THEY GOT THE POINT. I'LL BE THINKING OF Y'ALL WHEN YOU ARE IN FINANCE GETTING GROSSED FOR MORE THAN YOU CAN
SPEND BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL IMPULSE BUYING CRAZY ASS CRY BABIES
<h> My momma always told me, "Life is like a box of new car dealers..."
<p> Subject: DEAR DUMBASS
<p> I'M A TWENTY YEAR OLD FINANCE MANAGER IN A SMALL DEALERSHIP IN SOUTH CAROLINA, IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT COST ME MONEY, AND HEADACHES
WITH YOUR STUPID INTERNET SITES THAT JUST CONFUSE PEOPLE.................(BLAH, I cut him off, it drags on too long -Jeff).
<p> .........P.S. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR SOME OF YOUR IDEAS AND QUESTIONS JUST DON'T TAKE AWAY OUR SOURCE OF INCOME, BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU WHEN
YOU FIGURE OUT 1 SECRET WE HAVE ALREADY CAME UP WITH 3 MORE...LOL
<p> How are you doin Jeff?
<p> I am just writing to let you know that I am an Internet Manager in the #1 Chevy dealer in Nassau County (NY). I think that sites like this are great. It gives the
consumer info and definitely helps them form getting hurt. I just want to let the people know that not all of us are bad. I am in this business to make a living and
put food on the table. I work very hard and I EXPECT to make money from it. Of course it has to be legit. I feel that the car business does have a bad rap, but I am
working on it on my end. Just a message to the folks reading: It isn't necessarily a bad thing for a dealer to make money. Be fair and they will be fair towards you
(most of us). Don't expect something for nothing though. There has to be some profit. Just do some homework and you'll be fine. Buying a warranty isn't a bad thing
either. It's just like insurance. Over paying for a warranty is bad though. Like I said, do some homework and you will be ok. Thank you ! for reading. - Adam

<p> your article is offensive and absolute bull****! i have been in this business for a long time and have come across many people
like you who couldn't hack it in the auto industry and wind up trying to "expose" dealers as rip off artists our profit margins are low and have been for
the past couple of years. what are you selling? what is your profit margin why dont you attack the furniture or clothing business there profit margins can be
any where from 2 to 500%. better yet why don't you go f*** yourself!
<p> Jeff, I visited your sight for the first time today and found it very interesting. I am the General Sales Mgr. for a multi-franchise dealer in North-Eastern PA.
I think your sight is very helpful to customers and we welcome all customers who bring in internet research with open arms. This is 2003 and people want to shop with
convenience and accuracy. These people who give you a hard time must be "old school" salespeople. My message to them is to try selling from the heart, be
genuine with your customers, and under promise and over deliver. If you can't truly do this, GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS! It's not people like Jeff that give us a
bad name, it's people like you. Shawn Hunter GSM R &amp; R AUTO GROUP SCHUYLKILL HAVEN, PA.
<p> While most car salespeople are good honest people, some live by this principle: It is morally wrong to allow suckers to keep their money.
