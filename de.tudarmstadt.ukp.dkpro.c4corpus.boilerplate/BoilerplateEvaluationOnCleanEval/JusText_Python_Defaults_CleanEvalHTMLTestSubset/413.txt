<h> The Torricelli Defence
<p> I've had an eerie feeling for about two days that Democrats are about to come to their senses and realalize that they're stuck with a complete stiff. John Kerry's ineptness as a campaigner has been obvious to objective observers all along but the evidence is piling up high enough so that even the Democrat base won't be able to see over the top for long.
<p> My question is this - what are they going to do when it really sinks in that Kerry isn't going to make it?
<p> Democrats have already proved they are willing to "stretch" election law to the breaking point. Al Gore's failed attempt to steal the 2000 presidential election was only the most visible attempt at legal attacks on legitimate processes. Don't forget that they successfully replaced scandal plagued Senator Robert Torricelli at the last moment, against the law as written, with former Senator Frank Lautenberg.
<p> Then there's the variation on that strategy that Dems used in Minnesota. They replaced Paul Wellstone, who was tragically killed in a small plane crash, at the last moment, against the law as written, with former Vice President Walter Mondale. It did not work that time and Republican Norm Coleman, against the best predictions of the particularly left leaning Star Tribune, won the election. Win or lose, it demonstrates Democratic willingness to use activist, predictably leftist, courts to rewrite election law on the fly.
<p> So, back to my question. What are they going to do when it really sinks in that they have nominated a stiff? There are any number of knight-in-shining-armor types in the wings, just waiting for the chance to step in. Hillary Clinton comes to mind right away. She has quite a machine ready to go at a moments notice. John Edwards is also someone to consider. He is relatively untarnished and could easily step in to increase the Democrat's charm factor a thousandfold.
<p> Howard Dean? Er... no.
<p> The DNC has to be turning this over and over trying to find an angle, a scenario, a loophole that will open the door to the Torricelli defense. What do you think they are going to do?
<h> Comments
<p> Actually, I think you are wrong on this one. I think they do not realize how bad it is. Kerry should remain close in the polls until after the Republican convention. It won't be apparent to the other side until the debates begin.
<p> Now, will they do a "Torch Maneuver" atthat point? That is one for Las Vegas to work out the odds on.
