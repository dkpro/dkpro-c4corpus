<p> Ordered
nachos as starters which they forgot to bring until the main
course. Fajitas were only average. I was expecting them to
arrive sizzling hot but they weren't so the food was only
lukewarm.
<p> What
did you drink?
<p> Bottle
of house white at about £13 was okay.
<p> What's
the crowd like?
<p> Arrived
about 7pm on a Monday night so had a choice of tables. Got quite
full later on.
<p> And
the vibe?
<p> Nice
building but tables were a bit cramped and the chairs uncomfortable.
The couple at the next table started smoking so it was time
to skip dessert and coffee and leave.
<p> Anything
else you'd like to say?
<p> Overall
disappointing. Seem to be trading on reputation alone. There
are plenty of better options in York.
<p> Value
for money?
<p> £53
for 3 mains and wine. They didn't charge for the starters.

<p> York
<p> What's
the number?
<p> No
need! They don't take bookings!
<p> What's
the grub like, then?
<p> If
I was being generous I'd say it was fair. However, if I was
more honest, I'd say overrated. But my problem wasn't with
the food.
<p> What
did you drink?
<p> Bottled
beer and house wine. Slightly pricey, but tasted nice.
<p> What's
the crowd like?
<p> Couples
of all ages.
<p> And
the vibe?
<p> Crowded
and smokey upstairs
<p> Anything
else you'd like to say?
<p> Was
told you cant book, so turned up without a reservation and
had to wait two hours for a table. When we were finally seated,
we noticed many tables were unused. Upstairs the bar was packed
full of people waiting for tables and downstairs there were
LOTS of tables unused? I got the feeling they were just ushering
customers upstairs for an hour or two to get a few extra rounds
of drinks out of them. Very annoying! Not in a rush to return!
<p> Value
for money?
<p> I
paid £8 for a plate of nachos chips with a couple of dollops
of salsa for a starter.

is part of a Christmas tradition with us. We first visited
years ago and have returned regularly (always at Christmas
time) on our (at least) biennial shopping visit to York. The
food is always excellent and the steaks are cooked just how
you order them. I can also speak very highly of the 'bowl'o'red'!
This time round we tried the Christmas cake and Godminster
for dessert, and for a strictly Cheddar-only man like me this
was a real treat - Fantastic! However having since purchased
some of the aforementioned cheese I have been disappointed
not to be able to achieve the same kick.
<p> What
did you drink?
<p> Black
Sheep. Its as much a part of the tradition as admiring the view
through the bedsit window across the street from upstairs, or
banging my head on the low beams.
<p> What's
the crowd like?
<p> Sadly
the clientele appear to be getting younger; I say 'appear' because
I am a realist and suspect that age wise I now have more in
common with the fabric of the building than some of the punters!
<p> And
the vibe?
<p> Soapbox
time! Apart from it's everpresent inbuilt charm and ambience,
on this occassion I was put off (upstairs at least) by the fug
of smoke. The truth is I don't often get out these days and
to have an evening as special as this marred (not exactly spoiled)
by something as blatantly antisocial (its only social to those
who enjoy it) was a tad upsetting. No doubting where I stand
on the great debate then!
<p> Anything
else you'd like to say?
<p> If
you should visit in the week before Christmas be sure to have
a seat next to the roaring fire! Only my wife likes to sit next
to the window in the bar to see the Minster - so do I, of course!
<p> Value
for money?
<p> Always!
We shared the dessert and still couldn't manage it!

amazing.

<p> Fanastic.
Wide choice and variety. Took a long time to decide what to
order!
<p> What
did you drink?
<p> House
white, very nice.
<p> What's

<p> We
booked for mid afternoon so quiet. A few couples, work parties.
<p> And
the vibe?
<p> Trendy,
I could go with a partner or friends. I think it has the right
setting to make the atmosphere what you want. Lots of pictures
of famous stars everywhere, great.
<p> Anything

<p> Will
definately be going again. Staff were friendly and the food
exceptional.
<p> Value

<p> For
7; 3 courses and drinks it came to £180 which was good value
for money. Each course was a generous portion only just had
enough room for desert.
