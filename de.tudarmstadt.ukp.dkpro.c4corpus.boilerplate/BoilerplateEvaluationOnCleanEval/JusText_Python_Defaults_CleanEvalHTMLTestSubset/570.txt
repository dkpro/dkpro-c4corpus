<p> We're trying out a new location this year. New club-member Randy Word has a big ranch down near Granbury, and he's graciously allowed us to hold our shindig there. There's plenty of back-to-nature stuff to do there (hiking, fishing, etc) and lots of great activities for kids. Randy has also offered to smoke a batch of ribs for us, so we'll have plenty to eat and do.
<p> We'll likely be having a gift-exchange, so bring along a wrapped gift worth under $10 if you'd like to participate.
<p> It also looks like we're going to have a bigger-than-average group of young kids there, so if you bring along a wrapped toy (please keep it in the under-$5 range), we'll try to do a gift exchange for the kiddos. If your kid is older than about 8, the grownup exchange would probably be better.
<p> What: Metroplex Atheists Infidels Bash
<p> When: Sunday, December 17, noon until whenever (Randy has a fire-pit and cabins if we spend too much time partying)
<p> What To Bring: Randy will be smoking ribs and sausages, but we'll need any further fixins. If you'd like to bring some chips or soda or dessert or such, email director@metroplexatheists.org and I'll help coordinate snacks so we don't end up with twenty bowls of dip and no chips.
<p> Stay on 377 thru Cresson and on to Granbury, take 377 Business to downtown Granbury (the square with large rock courthouse).
<p> Go to the end of the square (1 block) and turn right on Hwy 4.
<p> Go thru town and then Hwy 4 angles/turns to the left immediately upon crossing the RR tracks.
<p> Continue on Hwy 4 to Thorp Spring. Stay on Hwy 4 to far end of town and look for FM 2580. Stay straight on Hwy 4 but immediately check your odometer. Go exactly 4.5mi from 2580 intersection to the turn into the ranch. There will be a street sign there that says "Ruff Country". You can only turn right so turn right onto Ruff Country (gravel road)
<p> Again check you odometer and go exactly 0.9mi There will be an open steel gate on your right. There is a green street sign attached to the gate that says "Randy Rd". Turn right and you are now in the ranch.
<p> Continue another 3/4mi on gravel/dirt road that will twist and turn and go down a steep hill and eventually across a creek. Don't give up, if you take a wrong turn inside the ranch just keep driving and you will find it.
<p> Following the closing of the old Humanist Hall in Grapevine, we'll be holding our November meeting at the NEW Humanist Hall in North Richland Hills. It's a good location with plenty of local eateries in reach.
<p> So come see us on the third Sunday at 11 AM (but not in December, because that's the party-day).
<p> Issue number 20 (May/June 2006) of Metroplex
Atheists' newsletter, The Atheist Voice is now available

of importance to atheists, and plan activism. Metroplex Atheists meet every

<p> Social Meetings:
<p> Several members of Metroplex Atheists also meet socially
at J. Gilligan's bar in Arlington on Wednesday nights. It's on Abrams
Street just east of the municipal complex. We usually meet around
6-7 pm. They close at 10 pm, but we're usually out before then. Hope to see
you there!

bimonthly newsletter of atheist thought, new, and opinions. Paper copies
of the newsletter are available at the Metroplex Atheists meetings. If
you're unable to attend the meeting, we've got downloadable versions of
the newsletter available here.
<p> Atheist Library. We have a good
library of interesting atheism-related books and other reading material
available for checking-out. Feel free to browse our titles
here.
<p> Book Study Group. We've got a formal book-study
that meets after the meetings. Check out our Book-Study Group Page
for more about the group.

<p> Metroplex Atheists is an outlet for the Emmett
Fields Bank of Wisdom
CD-ROM collection. These are collections of obscure atheist
literature available on CD-ROM for low prices. Many of these works
are very obscure and are only available publicly in these
collections. The pictured Robert Ingersoll CD, for example,
contains the entire 12-volume Dresden Edition collection of his
speeches and writings. This collection would cost over $1000 if
purchased on paper, but you can get it on CD-ROM for around $25.
<p> Book Covers And, of course, we sell the infamous
book covers that caused Pat Robertson to blow a gasket on the set of The
700 Club. We also ship covers out if you live outside of D/FW.
You can order them here.

News, Protest Reports, and Pictures
<p> October 18, 2005, Metroplex Atheists
called on Trinity
Church officials to restrict minors from viewing or working at its
fundraiser, because the content is not suitable for anyone under the age
of 18, yet many young children were in attendance.
<p> June 6, 2005, after
protesting the appearance, Metroplex Atheists is
calling for a public apology from Governor Rick
Perry after an appearance in Fort Worth where
the Governor insulted and mischaracterized Americans devoted to the
separation of church and state.
<p> May 2005, Metroplex Atheists members survived a showing
of the IMAX science film Volcanoes Of The Deep, which was
described as "blasphemous" for its statements that the universe is over
6,000 years old.
<p> April 19, 2005, Metroplex Atheists officially gave their
kudos to the Dallas National Day of Prayer committee for finally putting
together a NDOP event that wasn't a thinly-veiled political rally.
<p> May 1, 2003 was once again the day that Evangelical
Protestants all over the nation browbeat lawmakers into endorsing their
religion and give them bad press if they refuse.
We
were there to voice our opinion on the matter.
<p> August 17, 2002 was the date of the biannual Promise
Keepers event in Dallas. We were there.
<p> On June 12-14, 2002, the National Catholic Bishops'
Conference was held in Dallas to try to put together a
"policy" regarding pedophile priests. While we weren't aware
that violent crime required a policy other than "imprison the
perpetrators", we still showed up to voice
our opinion on the debacle.
<p> May 2, 2002 was the yearly National Day Of Browbeating
Lawmakers Into Endorsing Evangelical Protestantism And Giving Them Bad
Press If They Don't (AKA, the National Day of Prayer). Of course, we
were there to let 'em know what we thought.
<p> Following all kinds of theocratic nonsense in Palestine
TX, including a mandatory prayer rally in the public school and the
Texas governor's statements that schools should allow coerced prayer,
December 17 2001 was the date for a "get prayer back in
school" rally at a local church. Needless to say, we were there to
protest and several locals joined us to let everyone know Palestine is
not in lock-step on this issue. Check it out here.
<p> For the second year in a row, several Metroplex Atheists
decided to get the wits scared out of 'em. And what a better place to
lose ones wits than at a fundamentalist Hell House!
<p> August 19-25 was the second annual Scouting
For All protest of the Boy Scout headquarters in Dallas. We've got pics.
<p> On August 5, 2001, the Birdville TX school district
decided to waive fees and bend the rules a bit for a group that wanted
to hold a prayer-rally in the newly-built athletic complex. Needless to
say, we were there. The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram recently posted an article on the controversy.
<p> On December 6, 2000 our co-chair Shelly Hattan was
interviewed by The Infidel Guy.
Listen to the interview with your RealPlayer here.
<p> On October 27,2000, several Metroplex Atheists members
visited a Christian answer to haunted houses, the Hell House. Cringe
with us in gut-wrenching terror here.

Worth Texas, and Metroplex Atheists helped sponsor the event. Learn more
about the event here.
<p> August 21, 2000 was the national Scouting
for All protest. Members of Metroplex Atheists were
there to protest BSA's discriminatory policy against atheists. Our
co-chair has an open letter to United Way
that you can use to voice your support for the movement.
<p> George W. Bush did a quick appearance in Dallas on
August 19, 2000. Metroplex Atheists was there
to protest Bush's intention to institute "faith-based" welfare
programs.
<p> "Because we must. Because we have the call. Because it is nobler to fight
for rationality without winning than to give up in the face of continued
defeats. Because whatever true progress humanity makes is through the
rationality of the occasional individual and because any one individual we
may win for the cause may do more for humanity than a hundred thousand who
hug superstition to their breasts."
<p> -- Isaac Asimov, when asked why he fights religion with
no hope for victory
