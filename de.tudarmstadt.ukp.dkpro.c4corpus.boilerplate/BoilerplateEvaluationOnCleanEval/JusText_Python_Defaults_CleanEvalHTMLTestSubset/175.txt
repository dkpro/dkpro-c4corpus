<p> Switzerland has a healthy mix of small rural communities where cash is the sole method of payment, and international cities dedicated to the art of high finance, where anything will do nicely as long as it’s money. You’ll never be caught short – either for purchases or for cash withdrawals – if you carry your money in the form of only debit and/or credit cards, although the now rather pedantic travellers’ cheque still holds good. Switzerland is generally much safer than elsewhere in Europe, but carrying large wads of cash about is still not advisable.
<p> Most banks in the West keep Swiss francs on hand for over-the-counter exchange, and it’s a good idea to bring a small supply with you to cover first-night expenses in case of difficulties.
