<h> "Mcdonalds worker......older worker dealing with teenagers"
<p> I had started working at Mcdonalds in October of 2003 i am 41 years old
<p> i had been laid off from a good paying job and was working one part time job but needed some extra income First the didnt even have a uniform for me i am of average size and not over weight they made me wear a womens button down shirt that had no tails to tuck in and i was forever being told to tuck my shirt in .
<p> They let the teenagers get away with murder i was working like a fool to clean up cause i was a closer while these kids were throwing french fries at each other and buns that were dropped on the floor.then the assistant manager who was 23 the only thing she should be allowed to manage was her personal checking account was having a bad day and i was sweeping up trash from the dining room floor and the threw a bunch of fries on the floor at where i had just swept and said here have some garbage.
<p> the worst part was when they made me get down on my hands and knees and scrub the basebords in the dining and lobby area climbing under the booths and tables i was hired for GRILL work but i was always the one doing dishes and scrubbing the resrooms
<p> they cater to lazy people i had worked there over a month and had two breaks the first night i started and on 1 saturday nightand and that is against the law it is not like they are paying you for it think they hide the people that arent Mcdonalds model material
<p> in the back i worked with another guy close to my age but he had some tatoos on his arms so they hid him in the back too i am balding and slightly over weight and my teeth arent perfect so i was more or less a garbageman
<p> one young teenagers aspically made fun of me constantly saying he wasnt as stupid as I looked so i told the store manager nothing happened so i told the kid when you turn 18 im coming back to kick your ass he never bothered me again I told the store manager you may let them kids make fools out of you but they wont do it to me you will just about do anything to make money when you have a mortgage to pay but not work for mcdonalds
