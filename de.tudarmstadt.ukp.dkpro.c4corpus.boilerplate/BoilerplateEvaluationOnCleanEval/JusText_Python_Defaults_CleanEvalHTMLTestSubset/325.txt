<h> Christmas Tree Fertility
<p> Optimum fertilization promotes quality growth and
gives trees luxuriant foliage with a deep, rich color. Trees
with balanced nutrients are more resistant to pest problems
and environmental stresses. The amount of fertilizer or
lime needed to achieve optimum nutrient levels in the tree
will vary with different soils and sites or even different
land use history. Too much of a nutrient is often as harmful
to Christmas trees as too little. The only way to
optimize tree growth is to follow through with site-specific
fertilizer applications based on the results of timely soil and
tissue analysis. Effective fertilizer management is an
ongoing process that succeeds best when carefully planned
and maintained throughout the crop rotation.
<p> Soil samples should be taken regularly throughout
the course of growing Christmas trees. The first soil
samples should be taken during initial site evaluation. If the pH
or nutrients such as phosphorus or calcium are low,
materials can be tilled into the soil before tree planting
with greater success than later top dressing of fertilizers
or lime. Subsequent soil samples should be collected at
least every other year, and many growers choose to take
annual samples. Time invested in careful collection of
soil samples will increase effectiveness of any
following fertilizer applications. In North Carolina, soil
sample boxes can be obtained and samples sent from any
North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service County
Center. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture
provides soil and plant tissue analysis as well as other
diagnostic services to in-state residents.
<p> Once the trees in a field are well established,
plant tissue samples should periodically be collected along
with regular soil samples. Tissue analysis provides the status
of 11 nutrients inside the plant (four more than reported
in soil analysis). Tissue sampling also reflects what a plant
is actually able to obtain from the soil, not just what
is available. Under normal growing conditions,
tissue samples should accompany the soil samples at about
the middle of the rotation and then again the year
before harvest. Usually about two shoots are collected from
the same five to 10 trees from which soil is sampled.
Tissue sampling is a necessary tool for evaluating and
fine-tuning fertility management.
<p> When fertility problems occur in a field,
additional sampling can be useful. Problem areas should be
sampled (and managed) separately from normal areas of a
field. The contrast between normal and problem samples
can often pinpoint the cause of a fertility problem.
Often multiple-depth soil sampling can provide greater
insight than a single topsoil sample. When nutritional
problems occur, matching tissue samples should accompany
any special soil sampling. It may take several seasons
to correct a fertility problem.
<p> Fertilizer materials should be targeted to the
recommendations and deficiencies identified by soil and
tissue analysis for each field, without applying a single
blended material across the board. Annual applications of
nitrogen per acre are recommended based on the requirements
of the crop and the age and size of the trees.
Different amounts of a nitrogen fertilizer will be needed
depending on the percentage of actual nitrogen contained in
it. Different nitrogen sources have varying effect on
pH, soluble salt index, and leaching and should be
selected accordingly. Different blends can also satisfy the need
for certain amounts of phosphorous, potassium, or
other nutrients and should be selected to fulfill the ratio
of requirements for each nutrient. See Table 4 for a list
of commonly used fertilizers and their characteristics.

<p> Good where Mg and K both needed
<p> Both the timing and method of fertilizer
application are critical to successful nutrient management.
Different nutrients have their own requirements for timing.
Materials with a high soluble salt content containing nitrogen
or potassium should not be applied during the heat
of summer or during a drought. Large applications should
be split between two timings. Phosphorus should be built
up early in a crop rotation rather than adding an
incremental amount each season. Early in a rotation, many
growers band fertilizer outside the dripline of small trees
to maximize availability, but after trees are about 2 years
old, broadcast applications are most effective. Where
growers mechanize their fertilization, they are often able
to achieve a more uniform broadcast application.
While ground-applied fertilization is the primary method
of nutrient delivery, it occasionally must be
supplemented with foliar-applied liquid sprays particularly
where micronutrients are deficient or tied up in the soil.
<p> For a fertility program to succeed, a variety of
tools and methods must be used, usually in different
combinations from season to season.
<h> Field Borders and Stream Buffers
<p> Field borders and stream buffers are perhaps the
cheapest way to contain sediments and any nutrients or
pesticides that are present in the sediments. A 10- to
25-foot-wide grassy strip will trap sedimentation from all but the
most severe rain storms. These strips can usually double
as field roads.
<h> Low-Impact Site Preparation
<p> Some land currently in Christmas tree production is
too steep and erodible to bear extensive mechanical
site preparation. Soils also may be too shallow or
easily compacted to withstand the heavy traffic. Less
disruptive site preparation practices have been developed for
these situations. Any timber and brush is cut close to the
ground without disturbing the mat of roots that hold the soil
in place. All or a majority of stumps are left undisturbed.
No tillage is attempted. If seedlings are planted
mechanically, any areas near stumps are planted by hand or left
empty. Hardwood sprouts from stumps are a greater
problem with this approach, but labeled herbicides can
control them. Achieving optimum fertility may also be
more difficult without tillage, but by preserving the
topsoil, Christmas tree production can be sustained on
these difficult sites.
<h> Pest Scouting
<p> By scouting for pests, growers can reduce the frequency
of pesticide applications and the cost of pest
management program while increasing the effectiveness of their
efforts. Pest thresholds and scouting methods have been
developed for most of the major Christmas tree pests.
Information generated by scouting indicates the need for
pesticide applications and assures that such applications
are targeted to potentially damaging pest populations.
<h> Pesticide Alternatives
<p> Where several pesticides are labeled for a specific
Christmas tree pest, growers have the choice of selecting
the material that is least toxic to beneficial insects,
the environment, and wildlife. Toxicity of certain
pesticides to specific groups of animals, such as fish or
aquatic insects, can vary significantly. Safe pesticide choices
will change depending on proximity to critical habitats or
even the season and life cycle of vulnerable wildlife
species. Some less-toxic materials may require different
equipment, handling, or timing from traditional
pesticide choices. Be sure to evaluate all factors when
considering pesticide selection. For some pests, growers can
apply pesticides at alternative times, such as fall or winter,
when beneficial insects or at-risk wildlife are not present.
<h> Groundcover suppression rather than elimination is
a part of good management.
<h> Groundcover Management
<p> Production of quality Christmas trees depends largely
on the balanced management of weed competition. Unchecked weed competition hurts tree growth, but
repeated exposure of the soil surface with resulting
erosion will shorten the productive life of a field. Out of
necessity, growers have moved away from predominant use
of long-lasting pre-emergent herbicides and
bare-ground weed control. Groundcovers are the primary tool
for stabilizing the soil within a field of trees. Best
management practices involve suppression of native
vegetation and/or establishment of cover crops. This
reduces competition for nutrients, water, and space while
maintaining almost total coverage of the soil. An
alternative practice is to sow cover crops, such as clover or rye,
that reduce germination of native weed seeds and that can
be managed more uniformly. Regardless of the
approach, groundcovers are a second crop that must be
consciously managed in any Christmas tree field.
<h> Nutrient Management
<p> In North Carolina regions having sandy soils and
shallow water tables, nutrient management is a critical factor
in the availability of clean and healthy drinking water.
Large applications of fertilizer can possibly leach into
the groundwater. Smaller applications spread out over
a season can increase uptake by the crop and reduce
the probability of leaching. Leaching of fertilizer into
the groundwater is not generally a major problem, but
some precautions are still necessary. Best management
practices depend on regular use of soil and tissue analysis as
the basis for all fertilizer and lime applications.
Applications should be specific to the needs of each field.
Where practical, annual nitrogen requirements should be
split into two applications to reduce leaching potential and
risk of salt injury to tree roots.
<h> Pesticide Handling, Storage, and Disposal
<p> Pesticides are most hazardous when they are in
concentrated form during mixing, storage, and disposal.
Pesticides should always be mixed and loaded far away
from wells, springs, or streams. Progressive farmers are
installing covered and contained concrete mixing pads,
which capture any spills or rinse water. Secure pesticide
storage areas are built on the same pads. PVC field mixing
pads eliminate risky pouring from pesticide containers and
cost less than permanent facilities. When empty, all
liquid pesticide containers should be triple-rinsed and
punctured before disposal in landfills. Other methods of disposing
of containers are illegal and risk groundwater
contamination. For liability and safety considerations, farm managers
and foremen should all be knowledgeable about the
handling, storage, and legal disposal of pesticides and their
containers. Pesticide handlers must complete the
appropriate licensing and pesticide training.
<h> Wellhead Protection
<p> Poorly-constructed wellheads are a major source
of groundwater contamination from fertilizers or
pesticides. Good wells are grouted and sealed with concrete
and, ideally, enclosed in a concrete cover with a concrete
floor. Several management practices can reduce the risk
of groundwater contamination regardless of well
construction. No agricultural materials should be mixed at
the wellhead. Hoses or faucets should provide water at
a mixing area away from and preferably downhill from
the wellhead. A grassy buffer at least 10 feet wide
should protect the well from high traffic areas or any
pesticide application areas. The well cover should be above
the surrounding landscape and the immediate land
should slope away from the well. If production areas are above
a well, consideration should be given to the leachability
of fertilizers or pesticides used.
<h> Summary
<p> Christmas trees are a renewable and sustainable
agricultural crop. With appropriate consideration of
water quality, environmental considerations, and worker
safety, problems need not occur.
<p> Whether the vegetation occurs between the rows
or within rows is also important. Competition is
greatest from vegetation in the area immediately around the tree
or within a row. Vegetation growing between the rows is
less of a competitive threat simply because it is further
from the tree.
<p> Since perennial grasses are very competitive,
growers should minimize them within rows. In addition,
perennial grasses found between rows should be mechanically
or chemically mowed (suppressed via low rates of
post-emergence herbicides) to control competition.
<p> While woody vegetation is not particularly
competitive, it does interfere with tree work, and is easiest
to control prior to planting. Since most woody vegetation
is perennial with well established deep root systems, it
can be particularly difficult to control. Choice of
control measures and timing is critical.
<p> Vegetation desirable for use as groundcover
generally exhibits one of two useful characteristics: it is
naturally less competitive, or it is reliably controlled either
through mechanical or chemical mowing. Less
competitive groundcovers include broadleaf annuals or perennials
that seldom grow tall enough to interfere with tree
growth. Such species include strawberries, violets,
dandelions, plantains, groundsels, and common trailing
cinquefoil. Groundcovers that can and must be suppressed
because they are otherwise too competitive or interfere
with shearing or harvest include clover, smartweed, wild
carrot, yarrow, red sorrel, nimblewill grass, chickweed,
annual grasses, and some perennial grasses.
<p> The two principal methods for maintaining groundcover at an acceptable height between the rows
are mechanical mowing and chemical application,
either separately or in combination.
<h> Mechanical Mowing
<p> Mowing is an effective way to keep competing
plants under control between rows. Properly timed
mowing reduces competition, rodent damage, and fire
hazard. Rotary-type mowers are usually preferred for
grass control, as sickle bars are particularly apt to damage or
cut trees. However, mechanical mowing will favor
grass species that are most competitive to trees.
<p> Mowing alone must be repeated several times
during the growing season. It should be done often enough
to prevent the grasses from forming seeds that could
germinate within the row. Weather greatly determines timing
of the first and subsequent mowing operations. A cool,
dry spring can delay the first mowing. Subsequent
mowing during the growing season depends largely on the
frequency and amount of rainfall and fertility of the site.
<h> Chemical Application
<p> Herbicides are an effective substitute to
mechanical mowing for controlling competition by weeds and
grasses. Herbicides are generally classified as either
pre-emergent or post-emergent, depending on the stage of the weeds
the herbicide is designed to control.
<p> The effectiveness of a chemical can vary from
no response to a complete kill, depending on
application conditions and procedures. To be effective,
herbicides should be carefully selected. Several different uses
of chemicals are in new plantings in a cleanly
cultivated field, new plantings in a sod, or on established
plantations. Response to chemicals will depend on several
factors, such as size, kind and growing condition of target
plants, time of application, soil composition, rainfall,
temperature, rate of deterioration before being incorporated
into the soil, and persistence of the chemical. Most
properly-formulated herbicides are short-lived in the
environment, but still they must be carefully used to prevent
long-lasting effects by changing the composition of the plant
community.
<p> "Chemical mowing" is a term used to describe
the practice of applying post-emergent herbicides at low
rates to stunt or suppress weeds and grasses. This practice
was developed to provide growers with a cost-effective,
soil conserving alternative to broadcast application of
pre-emergence herbicides or mechanical mowing.
Chemical mowing can be used as a broadcast application or as
a between-row treatment where trees were
previously banded in the row with pre-emergence herbicides.
<p> Chemical mowing is generally more economical
than traditional mechanical mowing. The application of
low rates of herbicides two or three times during the
growing season is usually less expensive than maintaining
mowers and paying for the labor to mow several times a
season. Chemical mowing typically provides control for 6 to
8 weeks, compared to 3 to 4 weeks for mechanical mowing.
<p> Chemical mowing also fits well with many of
the strategies used in Integrated Pest Management (IPM).
It is especially important to the management of white
grubs. By leaving a ragged height of suppressed vegetation,
May and June beetles (the adults of white grubs) are less
likely to lay their eggs than they are in mechanically
mowed vegetation.
<p> It should be noted that the need for
pre-emergence herbicide applications cannot be totally eliminated
by chemical mowing.
