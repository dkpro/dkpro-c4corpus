<p> Originally planned for December 2002, this book club review has been
rescheduled once again for March 18th. It turns out the only two times
weve gotten any real snow this winter have been the days book
club was scheduled. Well, weve decided to give this book
one more chance. So, please come out and join us for some lively chat
at TEAMS new location.
<p> Note: Book Club is looking for their next book to review. If you have
a book youve recently enjoyed, please bring it along for discussion.
All are welcome.
<p> After the previous books were wide-ranging in scope, it's time now
for us to take an introspective look at our own profession with John
Heskett's new book Toothpicks and Logos. The author of the 1981
book "Industrial Design" (an essential item on every self-respecting
industrial designer's bookshelf) he now succeeds to define industrial
design by reflecting it against modern contexts such as cultural, technological,
environmental and corporate influences.
<p> "Design is one of the basic characteristics of what it is to be
human, and an essential determinant of the quality of human life."
- a principle that nurtures his book as much as our profession.
<p> Building on the success of the Book Club, the Chicago chapter is setting
up a new social event for Chicago Designers. Paul Hatch: "We found
that the chief attraction of the Book Club is the social aspect of the
meeting, which typically only briefly focuses on the chosen book. Discourse
then ran the full gambit of topics."
<p> Fight Club is a more targeted discussion, around a chosen topic of
debate such as a film, TV show or current exhibition. The first meeting
will be centered on the film Matrix Reloaded. Here, two volunteers will
take extreme pro and contra angles to debate the merits and pitfalls
of the film, the actors, and the genre. Everyone else can add their
spice to the debate on either side.
<p> First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules.
Second Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner.
<p> Being able to articulate and defend your opinion is one of the most
important skills a designer could have, and one that is rarely taught
in school. Join us on June 26 for the very first IDSA verbal slugfest.
<p> Come see how local designers use their 3D software. Which one is the
best? Is there a perfect software just for us? We will explore these
questions while Kent Solberg of Sram, Bart Brechja of Design-Engine.com,
Aaron Eiger of Design Integrity, and Chris Houghton of Insight model
up something cool for us! We will look at Rhino, Pro E, Alias, and Solid
Works.

Join us for a lecture titled, Whither Chicago? A newcomer's take on
the state of Chicago Architecture delivered by Ned Cramer, Curator of
the Chicago Architecture Foundation, where he is responsible for exhibitions
and for overall creative direction.
<p> For eight years Cramer worked as an editor at Architecture magazine,
most recently as executive editor. While at Architecture, he collaborated
with writers such as Paul Goldberger and Witold Rybczynski, artists
such as Doug Aitkin and Justine Kurland, and architects such as Diller
+ Scofidio and Venturi Scott Brown. He also orchestrated special thematic
issues including "Postpostmodernism" and "The Arizona
School." Previously, Cramer worked at the Menil Collection in Houston
and at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. He attended
the Rice University School of Architecture and is the recipient of an
Arts Administration Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.
Cramer was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri.

ways that you can be involved in the program.
<p> Please RSVP at www.archeworks.org or 312.867.7254
<p> Archeworks is an alternative design school where students work in
multidisciplinary teams with nonprofit partners to create design solutions
for social concerns.
<p> The 2003 IDSA National Conference
Will be held in New York City from Wednesday, August 13th running through
Saturday, August 16th, 2003 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square.
<p> After the success of the first Fight Club we knew there had to be a
follow up debate, so here it is: Sex and Violence.
<p> Most of Europe and Canada have less than 100 mortalities per year through
violence, whereas the US averages around 11,000 through guns alone.
The US has also cornered the market in its pornography business and
yet has one of the tightest restrictions on nudity on TV. Is it not
also contradictory to blur out partial nudity while we can watch decapitations
in full gory detail on primetime TV?
<p> This no-holds barred ‘street debate’ will cover these topics
and also discuss the effects sex &amp; violence has on TV viewers, what
censorship does, etc.
<p> French Vietnamese food that is highly recommended on Metromix, the
NY Times etc.

<p> As always, we will be asking for a $10 gift / donation suitable for
