<p> All children 7 to 15 years old
attend the nine year compulsory school. If parents so wish, the child may start
from the age of six. Options after the comprehensive school are upper secondary
school or vocational education. Upper secondary school: 2-year general school
leading to the Matriculation Examination, giving successful students access to
university and other higher education schools. The present vocational education
system covers both general secondary and vocational programmes, with separate
tracks for comprehensive school leavers and matriculated students. The system
is being reformed.

<p> Higher education in Ukraine is
administered by the Ministry of Educationwhich coordinates the activities of higher schools and supervises the
higher schools which are under other ministries. According to the "Law on
Education", higher education includes the following levels and categories

schools and other HEIs of a corresponding level; level II - colleges and other HEIs
of a corresponding level which teach Bachelor and junior specialist courses;

Bachelor's and Specialist, as well as junior specialist courses and ; level IV

comprises two stages: undergraduate and graduate, with several degree levels. A
Union of Rectors was created in 1993.
