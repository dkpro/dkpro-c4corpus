School for International Training (SIT)
Brattleboro, VT
<p> The vision expressed by SIT founder and president emeritus
Dr. John A. (Jack) Wallace is today realized more than ever
in education and training programs designed to build a global
citizenry capable of effecting positive change. Indeed, SIT
is now internationally recognized for its focus on practical
skills, intercultural awareness and ethical attitudes for professionals,
students and other citizens engaged in cross-cultural and international
action/learning. Equally important is the substantive and unique
body of knowledge generated by SIT alumni and others engaged
in its programs.
<p> Next spring, SIT will cap the year-long celebration of its
40th anniversary year by bringing together the experiences
of alumni, faculty, staff and close colleagues in a groundbreaking
conference focused on the knowledge generated through four
decades of practice and fieldwork. Using the experiential learning
cycle that continues to inform nearly every SIT program, the
one-day conference will provide a forum for presenters and
participants to reflect on experiences in various roles and
professions, to generalize and synthesize new knowledge, and
to share this knowledge with others in the process showcasing
the unique and evolving ways SIT has made significant contributions
to a more socially just, sustainable and peaceful world.
<p> Lessons learned during the Conference will be shared via electronic
and/or print media, will become part of SIT's history, and
will serve to enhance the institution's ability to fulfill
its mission as we go forward.
