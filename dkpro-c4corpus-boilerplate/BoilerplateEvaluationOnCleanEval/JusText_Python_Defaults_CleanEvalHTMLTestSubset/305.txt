<p> Visual difficulties may range from a minor condition
to total blindness, and Cambridge ESOL can supply enlarged and modified
question papers for less serious difficulties, or brailled and modified
question papers where these are required.
<p> Exams
<p> If you have visual difficulties, you can ask for
Special Arrangements to be made so that you can take the following exams:
<p> Key English Test (KET)
<p> Preliminary English Test (PET)
<p> First Certificate in English (FCE)
<p> Certificate in Advanced English (CAE)
<p> Certificate of Proficiency in English (CPE)
<p> Business English Certificates (BEC)
<p> International English Testing System (IELTS)
<p> Young Learners English (YLE)
<p> Certificates in English Language Skills (CELS)
<p> Certificates in ESOL Skills for Life
<p> Applications for Special Arrangements for other
ESOL examinations not listed above may be possible.
<p> Please tell us whether you need your papers in contracted
or uncontracted Braille.
<p> Please note:
<p> the supervisor will also have a print version of each Braille paper
<p> in some papers we arrange for the texts and the questions to be
brailled in separate booklets.
<p> We can send you past exam papers in Braille as practice
material. Please ask us in good time, if you would like us to send you
some past papers. Contact the ESOL Special Circumstances Unit (see the
Further information section below).
<p> 5. Enlarged Question Papers
<p> You can ask for two different kinds of enlarged
question paper.
<p> Type 1:
We enlarge the standard question paper making no changes to the layout
or material. You will receive A3 size question papers. (Usually 15.5 point)
<p> Type 2:
We change the question papers, removing 'visual' material which is not
essential for answering the question. We then make large-print versions
of the papers in A4 size. (Usually 18 point bold)
<p> Note that we can also supply reduced print question
papers.
<p> 6. Listening Tests
<p> We make special arrangements for these tests.
<p> Many of the questions in the listening tests ask
candidates to make notes while they listen to a tape. If you are blind
or have visual difficulties you may not be able to do this.
We produce a special version of the listening test.
<p> You will hear the same material and answer the same
questions as other candidates.
<p> However, the supervisor will:
<p> stop the tape before each part of the test to allow you enough time
to read the questions
<p> stop the tape at certain points during each part to allow you enough
time to write one or more answers
<p> stop the tape after each part to allow you enough time to check
your answers.
<p> You should note that when the tape is paused during
a part, you:
<p> may not need to write an answer at all.
<p> may need to write more than one answer.
<p> 7. Speaking Tests
<p> For KET, PET, FCE, CAE, BEC or CELS, you must normally
take the speaking test with a partner.
<p> If you have visual difficulties, you can apply to:
<p> have extra time if it takes you longer than usual to read any exam
material or decide what you want to say
<p> take the test with a partner who is not taking the examination
<p> take the test without a partner (i.e. in the parts of the test which
usually ask both candidates to talk to each other, you talk to the
examiner instead). (Please note that this option is not available
for BEC or CELS.)
<p> use adapted visual material (see below).
<p> Parts of the speaking test for some exams are visual
- they use pictures taken from newspapers or magazines, for example.
<p> If you are partially sighted we can supply enlarged
copies of these pictures. If you find it difficult to use enlarged pictures
we can supply enlarged print versions of written descriptions of the
photographs. Talk to your centre about which would be best for you.
<p> We can also supply material in Braille for blind
candidates.
<p> For example, in the Braille version of the FCE Speaking
Test:
<p> the examiner will spend a few minutes asking you to talk about yourself
<p> you will then be given short written descriptions of two photographs
in Braille. The examiner will ask you to compare and contrast the
situations in the descriptions and give your opinion about them. You
will have about a minute to do this
<p> finally you will be asked to take part in various conversational
activities using brailled notes or information.
<p> 8. Having a 'reader' or an amanuensis.
<p> A reader is a person who will read the questions
out to you. Note that the reader will not explain the questions to you
or offer any advice. A reader is not usually allowed to read out the
texts in a Reading Test.
<p> An amanuensis is a person who will write down your
answers. If you would like an amanuensis to write down your answers,
you should note that:
<p> you will be asked to spell certain words
<p> you must also indicate punctuation.
<p> The amanuensis will also read your answers back
to you if you wish.
<p> Please contact your centre if you would like to
know more about having a reader or an amanuensis.
<p> We recommend that you practise with a reader/amanuensis
before the examination. For example, you should make sure that you can
spell out the letters of the alphabet.
<p> Important notes
<p> Please note that it may not always be possible
for a Braille version of a particular examination to be prepared.
<p> British Standard Braille is moving over towards the optional use of capital letters. Skills for Life Level 1 &amp; 2 Reading may specifically test the use of capitals. Capitals will therefore be included in Braille versions of Skills for Life Reading in those tasks which test their use, and candidates who are preparing to take a Braille version of Skills for Life should be made aware of this. Capitals will not be included in texts or questions for other tasks for the time being.
<p> Cambridge ESOL reserves the right not to approve
applications for Special Arrangements. No application will be considered
unless it has the unreserved support of the centre.
