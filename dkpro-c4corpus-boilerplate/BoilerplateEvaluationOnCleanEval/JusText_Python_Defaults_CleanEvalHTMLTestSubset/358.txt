<p> "Purity
is the opposite of integrity—the cruelest thing you
can do to a person is make her ashamed of her own complexity.
The stories of our lives have no morals. Any single conclusion
drawn would be false; the episodes, taken together, are
untranslatable, incomparable. If we are to conclude at all,
we can only conclude against conclusions." -an excerpt
fromFighting
For Our Lives
<p> This is not the third 'CrimethInc.
book,' rather, it is the first
CrimethInc. Letters book. This is not
direct propaganda, nor is it similar in
most regards to previous CrimethInc. publications.
This is a new voice, a new form, a new
idea, but born of the same fires.
<p> These
are our letters—to the universe.
To each other. This is where we re-write
our histories and create our own cultures
without the mediation of corporations.
When we are too far away from one another
for campfire storytelling, we use our
own voices here, and we use them to call
out across the distance.
<p> Authors in the Letters series receive
10-20% (a sliding scale based on their
financial situation) of the gross revenue
for the book as payment: this is our effort
to actually build sustainability into
our pricing structure rather than nurture
yet another generation of victimized,
starving artists.
