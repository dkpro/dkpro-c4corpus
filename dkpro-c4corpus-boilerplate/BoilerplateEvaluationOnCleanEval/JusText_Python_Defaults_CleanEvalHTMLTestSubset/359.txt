<p> "The Bible and Public Schools: A First Amendment
Guide was prepared by the Freedom Forum'sFirst Amendment Center [1] and the National Bible
Association. It encourages schools to offer courses in the Bible as
literature.... The guidebook says supernatural happenings and divine actions
described in the Bible may not be taught as historical fact. And it says students
should be exposed to a variety of religious and secular Biblical
interpretations." [Diverse
Groups Endorse Bible Study Guide for Schools]
<p> "Critical to any teaching about religion in the public schools
should be inclusion and respect for a full range of religious and nonreligious voices,
and a recognition of religious pluralism as a source of strength for American
society...."[2]The
American Assembly
<p> "This is an historic day when we
can announce a broad consensus on teaching about the Bible in our public schools....
We have found common ground for common good." Chuck Stetson, vice chairman of
the National Bible Association.[3]

<p> Its
influential "friends" may threaten the Church far more than
its obvious enemies. One such dubious ally, the nice-sounding Freedom
Forum, has won the support of many Christian leaders by joining their quest for
"religious freedom" in public schools. Few seem to realize that the cost of this
questionable partnership is the purity of God's Word. Remember, the Bible's message ceases
to be God's uncompromising Truth when slashed by inter-faith criticism, judged by group consensus, and
molded to fit politically correct standards.
<p> Yet,
Christians across the country praise this revival. With their approval, a compromised
view of the Bible blends with other sacred writings and religious messages in the classroom. By a
strange consensus, these religions are being
adapted to fit a new
interpretation of the First Amendment -- one that twists its promised freedom into pretext and
control. Thus, schoolchildren learn "about the Bible" through a pre-planned group
process which twists God's truths into the evolving ideals of the planned global spirituality.
(See Mind Control)
<p> These strange
alliances alone should raise questions about Charles Haynes' First Amendment
Guide. So should
his membership on The Pluralism Project's
Advisory Board,
which includes Wiccan author Margot Adler
and Professor Diana Eck, an authority on
Hinduism who chairs Harvard�s Committee on the Study of Religion.
<p> "Pluralism
is an achievement.... It requires relationship, it requires engagement around
a common table, so to speak, of
our civic society." Dr.
Diana Eck, whose Pluralism Project CD, "On Common Ground:
World Religions in America,"
won praise from Charles Haynes.
<p> But there is a bigger reason for concern.
Mr. Haynes program plays a vital part in a worldwide movement that demands religious compromise, a
pre-planned consensus, and
a global ethic which turns God's values upside-down. Take a look at the global context
for his view of freedom:
<p> Promote
the
UN vision for global solidarity.
<p> For more than half a century, UNESCO has pursued the goal of its first
Secretary-General, Julian Huxley -- an avowed Socialist leader like his brother Aldous.
Now as then, the UN agency in charge of education, science and culture has shown little tolerance
for those who refuse to bend to its goals:
<p> "The mission of UNESCO... is that of advancing... international
peace and the common welfare... We have witnessed... the resurgence
of nationalism, the growth of fundamentalism and of religious and ethnic intolerance.
The roots of exclusion and hatred have
shown themselves even deeper and more tenacious than we had feared...
Peace... requires, in the words of the Constitution, 'the intellectual
and moral solidarity of mankind'."
[5](emphasis and link added)
<p> To
achieve solidarity, UNESCO must win public consent for mind-changing psycho-social strategies that
would mold and monitor the way people think everywhere. To win this consent, it needs a public crisis --
one that's either real, exaggerated or merely an illusion. Reality matters far less than
public perception.
<p> The crisis summarized in the
UNESCO mission fits the
need. With help from the media, it has already persuaded people around the world that "the resurgence of nationalism, the growth of
fundamentalisms and of religious... intolerance" is a "global threat." This
perception can now be used to conform, not only nations and "fundamental"
Christians to the UN vision, but also the Bible itself.
<p> Christians
who love God's Word know that His family is made up of people from "every
tribe and nation." In Christ, people from every race and culture become one. Yet, Biblical Christianity is considered too narrow and divisive for the globalist leaders who have been
planning the new solidarity since 1945. Notice the blatant intolerance toward Biblical
truth and other "certainties" in this 1946 statement by Dr. Brock Chisholm,
first head of the World Health Organization:
<p> "We have swallowed all manner of poisonous
certainties fed us by our parents.... The results are frustration, inferiority,
neurosis and inability to... make the world fit to live in....
<p> "It has long been generally accepted that
parents have a perfect right to impose any points of view, any lies or fears,
superstitions, prejudices, hates, or faith on their defenseless children.... [People with] guilts, fears, inferiorities, are certain to project their hates
on to others.... Such reaction now becomes a dangerous threat to the whole
world...."[6]
<p> God's
absolute, unchanging truth simply doesn't fit the new ideology. His absolute truth offends those who pursue contrary
beliefs and lifestyles. It seems "intolerant" and "hateful" to
those who seek public approval for their own ways. Charles Haynes
summarizes this view well:
<p> �Bitter
culture wars over abortion, homosexuality and other social issues are acerbating (sic)
our
religious differences. Exploding diversity is changing the face of our nation,
unleashing fear, intolerance and hatred in the process. And many Americans are fast
retreating into their own cultural and ethnic �tribes.�"
["21st-century
America must build ties, not rifts"]
<p> Our
leaders have a new word for this crisis: separatism. During a 1991 speech at a Communitarian Conference in Washington D.C.,
Al Gore said, "Seeing ourselves as separate is the central problem in our political
thinking." (See Clinton's War on Hate Bans Christian Values)The
opposite of Mr. Gore's separatism is the other "s" word: solidarity. To
understand its ominous meaning,
come with me to Habitat II, the 1996 UN Conference on Human Settlements. It included a day-long mini-conference
on "Solidarity" held at an elegant Turkish palace in Istanbul. Here, a
panel of global leaders moderated by Robert McNeil (of McNeil and Lehrer), outlined the
UN agenda for religious unity and social control. I taped and transcribed their
comments. Compare some of
their remarks (in boxes) with the comments by Charles Haynes and others who have
joined his crusade.
<p> Use
spiritual
unity to build the global community
<p> �I
have gathered leaders with tremendous wisdom and prestige. They are bringing the
spiritual dimension�the only ingredient that can bind societies
together.� Conference Secretary-General Wally N�Dow, Solidarity
panel
<p> �What�s
needed is an interfaith center in every city of the globe. The new
interfaith centers will honor the rituals of every� faith tradition�
and provide opportunity for sacred expressions needed to bind the
people of the planet into a viable, meaningful, and sustainable
solidarity.� James Morton, Cathedral of St. John the Divine and
Temple of Understanding, Solidarity panel
<p> The Temple
of Understanding, housed in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, serves as a meeting place
for various occult, inter-faith, and UN groups. Here international policy-makers have planned
their steps for establishing the global spirituality needed as an ethical foundation for the
envisioned global community. The Temple helped establish the Parliament of World Religions
as well as Gorbachev�s International Green Cross. According to its
Winter 1993 Newsletter,
<p> �The purpose of the Temple of
Understanding is the worldwide promotion of interfaith dialogue and education,
to achieve understanding and harmony among the people of the world�s religions and
beyond. � We invite your active participation and support.� (emphasis added)
<p> A 1991 Temple Newsletter shows the inter-faith/occult institution's
agreement with- and support for Charles Haynes and his Bible curriculum. Considering
that liberal media leader Henry Luce III, who signed the Williamsburg
Charter, was also a Temple board member, the broad associations should be no
surprise:
<p> �The Temple of Understanding
is collaborating with three other international interfaith organizations to form the
International Interfaith Organizations Coordinating committee, which has been meeting
to develop plans to celebrate 1993 as 'A Year of Inter-religious Understanding and
Co-Operation' by sponsoring a centennial celebration in Bangalore of the 1893 World
Parliament of Religions�..
<p> �Hartley
Films Offered Free to the Public Schools. Elda
Hartley, who began in 1965 to produce films on all the world�s great spiritual
traditions [except Christianity], has made her award-winning films on Eastern
religions available through the Temple of Understanding to school libraries
throughout the United States.
<p> [Statement by Elda Hartley:] �We
all wonder what we can do to promote global understanding. One way is to spread
understanding of other people�s beliefs, and here at the Temple of Understanding we
think that the best place to start is with young people in their formative years.
<p> "We are encouraged by the fact that
teaching �about� religion in the schools is receiving official approval in a
growing number of states. ... five states in the U.S. have offered pilot programs with a religious-liberty
curriculum issued by First Liberty Institute, a coalition of educators and
religious groups formed in 1988....
<p> �Charles Haynes, director of
the institute has written that �Growing numbers of educators throughout the United
States recognize that study about religion in social studies, literature, art, and
music is an essential part of a complete public school education. States
and schools districts are issuing news mandates and guidelines for the
inclusion of teaching about religion in the curriculum....'"[7]
<p> Redefine terms for a new social
contract
<p> �Citizenship
for the next century is learning to live together. The
21st Century city will be a city of social solidarity.... We have to redefine
the words... [and write a new] social contract.� Federico Mayor,
former head of UNESCO
<p> �One
key deterrent to the �disuniting of America� lies in reaffirming what it means to
be an American�. An �American� is one who has an abiding commitment to the
democratic first principles�.�
<p> Is
it? That's not what I learned when I became an American citizen. These
"democratic first principles" are part of Mr. Haynes' definition of the First
Amendment. They represent a new way of looking at the Bill of Rights -- one that ties
the right to express one's faith to a responsibility
to participate in a manipulative group dialogue. (See Trading U.S. Rights for UN Rules)
This form of dialogue teaches each person to replace individual
thinking with collective thinking under the noble banner of "common good." But his definitions include
other details.
<p> Finding Common Ground outlines the social contract for the
global village. It also illustrates
how its group of authors did "redefine the words" and introduce a new social
contract. Quoting from the Williamsburg Charter, which laid the foundation for The First Liberty
Institute headed by Dr. Haynes, it states,
<p> "The Compact Must be Mutual.
...that rights are universal and
responsibilities mutual is both the premise and the promise of democratic
pluralism�.. From this axiom� derives guidelines for conducting public debates
involving religion�."
<p> "First, those who claim the
right to dissent should assume the responsibility to debate:
Commitment to democratic pluralism assumes the coexistence with one political
community of groups whose ultimate faith commitments may be incompatible, yet whose
common commitment to social unity and diversity does justice to both the requirements
of individual conscience and the wider community. A general consent to the obligations
of citizenship is therefore inherent�."
<p> "Second, those who claim the
right to criticize should assume the responsibility to comprehend�.
Genuine tolerance honestly weights honest differences and promotes both impartiality
and pluralism. Debased tolerance results in indifference to the differences that
vitalize a pluralistic democracy�."
<p> "Third, those who claim the
right to influence should accept the responsibility not to inflame�."[8]
<p> The last statement
points to a basic, though unstated, ground rule for the consensus process: Don't offend
the diverse group members with politically incorrect expressions. Unpopular
facts or ideas clash with an essential part of the transformational process: building trusting relationships
that bridge the inter-faith and cross-cultural divisions. Naturally, it doesn't take long
before the group's
disapproval intimidates most dissenters into silence. Few Christians dare voice
contrary facts, values or
beliefs that might violate another person's comfort zone. That's
against the rules!
<p> Trade
individual thinking for collective thinking.
<p> �Change
your whole way of thinking, because the new
order of the spirit is confronting and challenging you.� Millard
Fuller, Habitat for Humanity
<p> In 1995, UNESCO's Commission on Culture and [human] Development
issued a report titled, Our Creative Diversity. On page 11, it states
that...
<p> �The
challenge to humanity is to adopt new ways of thinking, new ways of acting, new
ways of organizing itself in society, in
short, new ways of living."
<p> The message behind these words is staggering. Everything
must be changed -- especially the way we think of ourselves in relationship to the
"greater whole." When applied to religion,
the "new ways of thinking" means setting aside "narrow" or
inflexible beliefs for the sake of unity and "common good." Christianity
must either bend or break.
<p> When students evaluate the Bible from this pluralistic
or collective point of view, they are forced to criticize their own beliefs and compromise all truths that
don't fit the new mental framework. Only
a cross-less, malleable, ever-changing form of Christianity would pass the test.
<p> "We also believe, however, that there should be room in the
curriculum for a capstone course that high school seniors might take, in which
they learn about the most important frameworks of moral thought, secular and
religious, historical and contemporary, and how such frameworks might shape our
thinking about the most urgent moral problems we face.
<p> "...It is striking to us that most economics texts (quite properly)
include discussions of Marxism and socialism, but none that we have seen says anything
significant about religious ways of thinking about economics."[9]

change in the "right" direction
<p> �We
should stop bemoaning the growth of cities. It�s going to happen and it�s a
good thing, because cities are the vectors of social change and transformation. Let�s
just make sure that social change and transformation are going in the right
direction." Dr. Ismail Serageldin, Vice President of the World Bank
<p> "The right
direction" means shifting from the Christian worldview (or paradigm) to the Global
worldview. Some call it a paradigm
shift. Look at the three main paradigms (ways of thinking and
understanding reality) of the last fifty years. Notice that secular
humanism was only a brief transition stage. By the turn of the millennium, our culture
had generally embraced the global
paradigm. Religion
is once again acceptable -- as long as it reflects the new pluralism.

<p> Professor John
Goodlad worked on the 1987 Study Commission on
Global Education with Bill Clinton and Ernest Boyer, former president of CFAT (Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching). Boyer, in turn, supported Charles Haynes' agenda for
using the Bible to spur interest in interfaith dialogue. In his Preface to Schooling for a Global Age, Goodlad wrote:
<p> �Enlightened
social engineering is required to face situations that demand global action now�.
Parents and the general public must be reached also, otherwise children and youth
enrolled in globally oriented programs may find themselves in conflict with values
assumed in the home.�
<p> Does this
sound like manipulation and brainwashing? It should! Successful "social engineering"
must mold the minds of the masses so effectively that no
rational argument can persuade the people to turn back. In the light of Professor
Goodlad's vision -- and
of the paradigm shift shown above -- consider the meaning behind the following
statements from UNESCO�s report, Our
Creative Diversity:
<p> �Education must inform� but it must also form, it must provide them with a sense of meaning to guide their actions�.
Education should promote �rational understanding of conflict, tensions, and the
processes involved, provoke a critical awareness� and provide a basis for the analysis
of concepts that will prevent� chauvinist and
irrational explanations from being accepted�.�
<p> "Its
primary task is to provide information, explain and analyze problems and subject them to
criticism�. It should cover adults as
well�. The principle of lifelong education� should be the aim of all societies.�[10]
<p> The
second paragraph shows three important steps in the consensus process: Provide the
selected pieces of information needed to persuade the group members, explain the
problems (or crises) from the global or pluralistic perspective, then subject it to the
criticism of the group. The members will think their ideas are their own, never
realizing they were suggested to them by the information and context provided by the
facilitator. Eventually, these steps to "Finding Common Ground" becomes
a lifestyle.
<p> Back in the
fifties, Edward Hunter wrote the book, Brainwashing,
an insightful expose documenting Soviet brainwashing strategies in China and other Communist
countries. A summary of his book can be found in the U.S. Congressional Record. (See Communist
Psychological Warfare) Mr. Hunter's warnings
should shine a red light into our foolish presumptions that this process couldn�t be
used in our free nation.[11]
Compare his warning below with the above comment from Our Creative Diversity:
<p> �Even when he stands by himself,
the truly indoctrinated communist must be part of the collective. He must be
incapable of hearing opposing ideas and facts, no matter how convincing or how
forcibly they bombard his senses. A
trustworthy communist must reach in an automatic manner without any force being
applied.�[12]
<p> In
other words, the key to change is establishing in the minds of people the new world view -- the collective
way of thinking, of seeing and of understanding social issues. The main strategy for
accomplishing this change is the consensus process.
<p> Break
down boundaries and build consensus
<p> The
UN vision for global
solidarity demands continual measurement of
social
capital in every community. To raise their score on this international assessment of community oneness,
leaders are seeking ways to involve everyone in the
consensus
process. Two of the more common labels for this process are "Conflict
Resolution" and "sensitivity training." While it often helps to resolve genuine
conflicts (that's the crisis needed to bring people into the process), it's main purpose is
to change the way people think and relate to each other.
<p> The vision
for this social transformation was articulated back in 1948 in a statement titled,
"Mental Health and World Citizenship�, prepared for the International
Congress on Mental Health, which met in London. Notice their strategy for change:
<p> �Social
institutions such as family and school impose their imprint early � Thus prejudice,
hostility or excessive nationalism may become deeply embedded in the developing
personality� often at great human cost.... Change
will be strongly resisted unless an attitude of acceptance has first been engendered.�
[14]
<p> Now,
more than five decades later, there is little resistance to the planned
social transformation. In Finding
Common Ground, Charles
Haynes, tells us that,
<p> �Establishing a climate where people listen to one another requires that we go
beyond labels and rebuild trust�. Putting aside labels and stereotypes and taking
seriously the position of the �other side� are the starting points for genuine
dialogue.�
<p> Sounds good,
doesn't it? People long for a climate of trust and friendliness. The
question is: can you trust this process? Designed to manipulate groups toward a pre-planned
change in values, Mr. Haynes' principles will indeed "create an attitude of acceptance" for the
new way of thinking. But this attitude tends to immunize children against Biblical faith.
Rather than promoting neutrality, it promotes pluralism and a universalist distortion of
Christianity.
<p> Mr. Haynes
assures his followers that all beliefs must be respected. That's partly true.
But continual tension and compromise is essential. "Conflict and debate are vital to
democracy," writes Haynes in Teaching the
Role of Religion in American History.
<p> Haynes'
assurances only make his program more deceptive. Keep in mind, conflict and dialogue are
vital to the consensus process. And the trained teacher/ facilitator can't lead the
dialogue effectively without the tension created by diversity. This tension
energizes members and, when used correctly, produces
synergy. You can't train
people to compromise (or synthesize) without opposing views -- a "thesis and
antithesis." That helps explain why the consensus process must include
all these elements:
<p> The true
dialectic group never reaches a final consensus, for change must
an ongoing process: one step today; another tomorrow. Continual change
is a global motto. To permanently change the way people think and relate,
our leaders must continue to set the stage for conflict and compromise week
after week, year after year. Group thinking and the dialectic process must
become as normal as eating. Eventually, people learn to discard all their old mental
anchors and boundaries -- all the facts and faith that maintained their firm convictions. They become like boats
adrift, always ready to shift with any wind or current that comes their
way.
<p> The Association for
Supervision and Curriculum (ASCD, the curriculum arm of the NEA) has supported Mr. Haynes
programs for many years. In 1970, it published To Nurture Humaneness, which
offers a glimpse of the envisioned goal:
<p> "...absolute behavior control is
imminent.... The critical
point of behavior control, in effect, is sneaking up on mankind
without his self-conscious realization that a crisis is at hand.
Man will... never self-consciously know that it has happened."[16]
<p> This statement
by Professor Raymond
Houghton points to the effectiveness of today's sophisticated version of the old Hegelian dialectic process -- the heart of the
Soviet
brainwashing
system. It was infused into the U.S. education even before 1985, when President Reagan
and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev signed a formal U.S. - USSR Education Exchange
Agreement. Finding
Common Groundfits right in. Its prescribed steps to transformation
match the corresponding steps taught by UN leaders, by management guru Peter
Drucker, and by church growth leaders such as Rick Warren:
<p> 1.
"Agree on the Ground Rules"
<p> 2.
"Include All of the Stakeholders"
<p> 3. "Listen to All Sides"
<p> 4.
"Work for Comprehensive Policies"
<p> 1.
"Agree on the Ground Rules"
(Leaders
agree, others follow):
<p> Finding
Common Ground lists some basic principles for small group dialogues that
sound reasonable. Problem is: the words they use hide new meanings that
change the context. "Rights" include the politically correct "right" not to
be offended by contrary truth or arguments. "Respect" includes the "right"
to be appreciated and affirmed, no matter how irrational or unbiblical one's
beliefs. Responsibility, among other things, refers to the obligation to
follow the new social guidelines. Group members are held accountable, not to
personal convictions, but to ambiguous and open-ended "rules" such as these:
<p> "These principles are the �ground rules� within which we negotiate our
differences� At the heart of these
principles, are the �three Rs� of religious liberty: Rights� Responsibilities�
Respect�.
<p> �If
these� civic ground rules are in place, then all sides come to the
table prepared to take responsibility to protect the rights of others and to
debate differences with civility and respect��
<p> Hidden in these
phrases is the understanding that absolute facts and uncompromising faith in
God's Word are not appropriate in the consensus process. Words that imply that your beliefs
might be more true than other beliefs could offend the group. Therefore, participants
may freely share their
thoughts and feelings, but not their uncompromising convictions.
<p> In this
context, it makes perfect sense that Charles Haynes and Warren Nord would emphasize the
law that backs this rule:
<p> ��the courts have made it clear that public schools cannot
teach students that the Bible is true�.�[17]
<p> �Supernatural
occurrences and divine action described in the Bible may not be taught as historical
fact.
<p> This
policy is as important to the new international education program (see
Mind
Control) as it is to Mr. Haynes and the Freedom Forum. Back in 1989, Dr. Shirley
McCune summarized this policy in her keynote speech at the Governors� Conference on
Education:
<p> �The revolution� in curriculum is that we no longer are teaching facts to children�. We no longer see the teaching of facts and information
as the primary outcome of education.� [18]
<p> "What
will take the place of logic, fact and analysis
in the coming age?" This rhetorical question was raised by Dr.
Donald A. Cowan, president emeritus of the University of Dallas. His revealing answer
exposes an important step toward the new consensus:
<p> "The central way of
thought for this new era will be imagination....
Imagination will be the active, creative
agent of culture, transforming brute materials to a higher, more knowable state."[19]
<p> Why is the
imagination so important to the new way of thinking? Because, unlike fact and faith, the
imagination can be manipulated through all kinds of stories, myths, and images. By
putting "teaching about the Bible" into a context teeming with timeless myths
and inter-faith idealism, God's Word becomes little more than just another myth, a
collection of stories -- one that may seem far less noble than other, less honest,
"sacred" books.
<p> 2.
"Include All of the Stakeholders"
<p> Remember
the UNESCO goal: solidarity. To reach this goal, its worldwide education system must
involve everyone -- young and old -- in the consensus process. To end separatism, every
mind must be molded to fit the new paradigm. Each person must learn to think
collectively and follow the group -- which in turn must be manipulated by a trained
facilitator.
<p> Finding Common Ground echoes this aim: �If agreements and policies are to inspire broad support in the community, all
stakeholders must be fully represented in the discussion...."
<p> To help
schools deal with resistance from Christian parents, it offers this advice,
�When
school boards or administrators reach out to critics� particularly religious
conservatives, they must look beyond media stereotypes and identify those
representatives most interested in dialogue and consensus.��
<p> Engaging
your "enemies" in the consensus process is vital to the new global management
system. That's why the same advice is emphasized in strategy reports from the United
Nations, from the President's Council on Sustainable Development, from the U.S.
Department of Education (See The U.N. Plan for Your Community),
and from Church Growth managers across the country.
<p> �[It]
is an ongoing process of planning that enables a congregation to make
plans but also to adapt and change�. In
fact, the underlying assumption is that the plans will change and that they must
change if the Church is to be effective in today's world.
<p> "
<p> UNESCO
leaders would smile. In the 1993 report, Education and Human Development, they wrote that UNESCO
Education �is aimed at two essential goals�:
<p> SOCIALIZATION:
�Education� for
all the world's citizens� is essential because education is the principal means
for preparing people to participate effectively in the development of their communities
�.�
<p> TRAINING FOR GLOBAL WORKFORCE: �Education
must prepare the citizens of today to live and work� in a world in which the only
constant will be change.�
<p> "All
the world's citizens" naturally includes parents. So it makes sense that Mr. Haynes
and Mr. Nord, writing for the Communitarian Network, echo our Department of Education's
goal of involving all parents in the consensus process. In their section on "Parental
Rights and Responsibilities," they write:
<p> "A
civil public school is also one that recognizes, in the words of the Statement
of Principles, that parents have 'the primary responsibility for the upbringing
of their children, including education.' This means that parents
should be informed and involved when the school addresses religion and religious
liberty."
<p> That
statement may sound innocent enough, but it tells us that Haynes is working right along
with our Department of Education on involving parents in the new "seamless"
system of "Lifelong Learning." As Professor
John Goodlad said,
"Enlightened social engineering is required.... Parents and the general
public must be reached also, otherwise, children and youth enrolled in
globally oriented programs may find themselves in conflict with values
assumed in the home."[20]
<p> 3. "Listen to All Sides"
<p> Finding
Common Ground tells participating schools that...
<p> "Establishing
a climate where people listen to one another requires that we go beyond labels and
rebuild trust. � Putting aside labels and stereotypes and taking seriously the
position of the �other side� are the starting points for genuine dialogue.�
<p> That
sounds good until you apply the ground rules that create a climate of intimidation for
all politically incorrect beliefs and facts. Since unpopular beliefs might offend the
group, dissenting voices are often silenced or minimized in the group's concluding
opinion or "common ground."
<p> 4.
"Work for Comprehensive Policies"
<p> Finding
Common Ground, encourages teachers to �begin
the search for common ground with the areas where agreement is most likely to be
achieved� Once the first agreement is reached, a foundation is created for
consideration of more divisive questions.�
<p> It
makes sense, doesn't it. Once a group has built a measure of programmed
"trust" and established pattern of compromise and consensus on small issues,
its far easier to compromise on bigger issues. Eventually, no one dares think or
conclude any significant issue without considering the feelings of the group. Few now
dare dissent for fear of violating the group standard for supportive relationships.
<p> Follow
God's unchanging guidelines
<p> Using
Charles Haynes approach to "teaching about the Bible," would Christian
children learn to stand firm, as God instructs, on the basic -- but politically
incorrect -- truths of the Gospel? For the likely answer, ponder these differences
-- take to heart God's Word, our weapon against the forces of deception and
darkness:
<p> Consensus

<p> Aim

pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ."
Gal. 1:10
<p> Instead,
"stand against the wiles of the devil. Therefore
take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
having done all, to stand." Ephesians 6:11-12
<p> Establish
solidarity through the community by manipulating minds, through
UNESCO's "lifelong learning," and by changing the
culture.
<p> Seek peace and unity in Christ, not in human plans. Good intentions
can't win spiritual battles. Apart from Christ, peace and unity are illusions.
<p> "These
things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have
tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." John 16:33
<p> Conform
to evolving group views to the pre-planned values of the envisioned global
community.
<p> Be
transformed by His Word, not conformed to the world. The "new ways
of thinking" bring deception, while His thoughts bring the delight of His
presence.
<p> "Do
not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that
you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God...."
Rom. 12:2
<p> "...you
have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through
faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness...." 1 Timothy 3:15-16
<p> Professor Diana L. Eck,
an expert on Hinduism, chairs Harvard�s Committee on the Study of Religion. She
created a multi-media CD for the Pluralism Project titled "On Common Ground: World Religions in America."
"Pluralism is an achievement,� she explained. ��It requires relationship, it
requires engagement around a common table,
so to speak, of our civic society." There's "no
question" the project has "the potential to wake people up to the importance of
religion in the curriculum,"
said Charles Haynes. [Holly J. Lebowitz, Religion News site http://www.religionnews.com/,

<p> [2] On March 23, 2000, The American
Assembly convened a three-day conference to "define policies and actions
concerning the role of religion in American public life." Titled Uniting America:
Toward a Common Purpose, it aimed "to reverse some of the most difficult and
divisive forces in our society." Charles Haynes was a co-director of this
Assembly. Haynes also moderated a panel discussion which included Forrest L. Turpen as
a panelist. The liberal and global-minded Ford Foundation and the Henry Luce
Foundation helped fund this Assembly.

According to the first footnote in this article, this paper is a shorter version
of another article by Nord and Haynes titled Taking Religion Seriously Across the
Curriculum, which was published by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum
Development in August, 1998. "Background documents and consensus guidelines for
understanding the civic framework outlined in the paper may be found in Finding
Common Ground: A First Amendment Guide to Religion and Public Education (1994, 1996,
1998), edited by Charles C. Haynes and Oliver Thomas. The educational framework is
developed at considerably greater length in Warren A. Nord's Religion and American
Education: Rethinking a National Dilemma (1995)."

<p> Tolerance
is respect, acceptance and appreciation of the rich diversity of our world�s
cultures�It is not only a moral duty,
it is also a political and legal requirement.
<p> Tolerance
involves the rejection of dogmatism and absolutism�. [Biblical truth?]
<p> Tolerance�
means that one�s views are not to be imposed on others. [Would this end freedom to share the gospel with others? Could the UN still share
its views?]
<p> Intolerance�
is a global threat.
<p> Scientific
studies and networking should be undertaken to coordinate the international
community�s response to this global challenge, including analysis� of root
causes and effective countermeasures, as well as� monitoring�.
<p> Tolerance
promotion and the shaping of attitudes of openness, mutual listening and
solidarity should take place in schools and universities, and through non-formal
education... at home and in the workplace.
<p> Promote rational
tolerance teaching methods that will address the cultural, social, economic, political
and religious sources of intolerance�major roots of violence�.
