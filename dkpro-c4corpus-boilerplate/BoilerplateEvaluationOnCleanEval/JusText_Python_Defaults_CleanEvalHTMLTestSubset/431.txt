<p> Best Rib Roast12/31/2005 at 07:01pmUser:Bob from Chesterfield, MIUser Rating:

<p> Absolutely Wonderful!12/31/2004 at 12:53amUser:ERIC from Iola, WIUser Rating:
I made and served this at a dinner party tonight. This was the first time that I made a "prime rib". I did follow the procedure in the TV program by purchasing a 4 rib "choice" standing rib roast and had my butcher cut off the bones. Instead of using a pot to cover the roast I placed a stone baking sheet both below and above the roast in the oven. I also cooked this a bit longer, removing from the oven at 120, letting stand until 130, then taking into the crusting stage. I cut and served the roast once it was past 145. I served this with Alton's garlic mashed potatoes and Emeril's horseradish cream sauce as well as the sage sauce.
Again a wonderful dinner for 5 adults and 5 children. I will make this one again.

It took me several days to find the right pot, but in the end it was the most fantastic piece of meat. It was my first attempt at a large piece of meat (10 pounds). I was a little worried in the beginning about the temp not rising fast enough but at almost exactly 4 hours, the digital temp was 118. I pulled it out, took off the lid and covered with foil. About 25 minutes later, the alarm went off on the thermometer at 130. The rest is history. Talk about fantastic. My Christmas dinner was a great success. Thank you sir.
<p> It's a Wonderful Roast12/29/2004 at 11:34amUser:CYNTHIA from Clinton, NYUser Rating:
Slow cooking the roast, after the aging, made it juicy and wonderful. It would be helpful, though, to have an idea of how many minutes per pound to allow for cooking. Our dinner was delayed because I hadn't timed it properly! If that were available, I'd give it 5 stars.
<p> Tasted fabulous - although a bit on the rare side.12/28/2004 at 06:17pmUser:CHRISTINA from Los Angeles, CAUser Rating:
I thought this prime rib tasted great. It was juicy and flavorful, and best of all - easy!
The only issue that I have with the recipe concerns that cooking temp/time. After taking the roast out of the oven when it reaches 118 degrees, how is it supposed to reach 130 degrees? I understand that the foil will contain the heat and continue the cooking process, however how is it supposed to actually increase the temperature??? I think this had something to do with the extreme rareness of the roast, so I'm wondering what others may have differently? (I happen to love rare beef, but some of my guests unfortunately didn't.)
Just wondering, how crucial do you think the clay pot is? The ease of this recipe is slightly affected by having to lug a fairly heavy terra cotta pot into the oven.
<p> A couple of Observations12/28/2004 at 05:43pmUser:JANE from Atlanta, GAUser Rating:
My first time with this recipe, but I got raves for Christmas dinner. Here is an observation on the heat to help the next cook:
1) Since I cook on a vintage 1936 Magic Chef, I used both an electronic oven temp gauge and a meat thermometer. Even though I kept the oven temp turned to the required 200 degrees, the oven temp was registering at 300 degrees -- probably due to the clay pot holding heat. This meant that the meat cooked a lot faster than I expected. Don't know if this is "right" or not, but the end result was fantastic, so it probably doesn't matter.
2) I expected the roast to end up medium rare, but it was very rare, even though I followed the temps exactly. This seems to be the experience of some of the other cooks here. I'm going to try it again and see what happens.

I cooked the meat to 130 degrees, let it rest for about 10 minutes while oven heated to 500 degrees. Then I cooked it to internal temp of 145 degrees for a medium rare/medium roast. It was perfect! I might cook it to 125 &amp; 140 degrees next time for more of a medium rare finished product. I have been cooking rib roast every Christmas for 6 years and this was the best one yet for nice crisp crust. Also, very few juices in the pan - all were in the meat!
<p> Good Prime Rib12/26/2006 at 11:22amUser:ashleigh from Parma, OHUser Rating:
I skipped the dry aging and planter processes. I just followed the temperatures of the oven and meat temps. I put the roast in at 10:30 and it was done by 3:30 (if that helps with timing) using a 3 bone roast. It turned out perfectly medium rare throughout. I made an Au Jus without the pan drippings (1 cup of wine, 2 cups of beef stock, salt and pepper) and it tasted fine without the drippings.
<p> "Aged" was right...but not for the beef!12/26/2006 at 12:40amUser:David from Chandler, AZUser Rating:
The results were delicious, but the roast took FOREVER!
I finally gave up after more than 8 hours. I wanted the beef medium (rather than medium rare). It took almost 7 hours to get to 118; I finally took it out of the oven at about 130. After its final crusting, it eventually reached 145, which was perfect for my taste--still quite pink, but not red.
I'm not sure why it took so long: was the clay pot I was using too heavy? Was the roast too cold (it essentially went from the fridge into the oven, and the thermometer started out at 32 degrees!)? The pot I used had a dark interior--was that the problem? The roast was tied--did that affect the cooking time?
We were quite pleased with the texture, taste, and appearance of the finished roast, but Christmas dinner after 9 p.m. was NOT part of the plan!
Next time I make this (and I will make it again), I will bring the roast to room temp before putting it in the oven, and I will probably dispense with the clay pot.

I was really unsure of the dry aging thing, convinced I was going to poison us, but I followed this exactly and I stunned my own self with how utterly perfect this roast turned out.
My people went crazy for it. It was perfectly rare, almost fork tender and absolutely juicy. I had no leftovers! They even ate the bones!
Alton, I should never have doubted you. You made my Christmas dinner the best ever and I got all the kudos!

This is some awesome prime rib, and really not hard to do at all. And don't let the dry aging thing scare you, it's easy and makes a big difference in the end result.
I deviated a little by heating the roast to 127 F before pulling it out of the pot (which took about 5 hours). After the high heat sear and a 40 min rest, it turned out a perfect medium rare.
I could only find a 14" azalea pot in my area...which makes a big difference when you're trying to find a baking dish that will fit underneath. I ended up buying a inexpensive 12" stainless steel skillet and sawing the handle off...which fit perfectly. It also worked well when making the jus afterwards.
But yeah, make this and your "kitchen timid" friends will think you're a master chef =)
<p> Best rib roast I ever cooked12/25/2005 at 06:11pmUser:JANET from Bergenfield, NJUser Rating:
I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of Alton. A few weeks ago, we happened to catch this episode. We watched it because I always cook rib roast for Christmas. The past few years, I have cooked it at low heat using a slightly different recipe. It was definitely better than the higher heat method. But we had never aged the meat or crisped it at the end. I only aged it 2 days. I didn't do the clay pot -- just my roasting pan. Hands down, this was the best rib roast I have ever cooked. After reading all the reviews here, I left it in to 125? instead of the 118. Then let it rest to a little over 130. Then I crisped it. The roast was done to perfection. Absolutely fabulous. This recipe is a winner! I will never cook it any other way.

When the roast goes back in for a crisping at 500 degrees, is it covered with the pot or foil or nothing at all? How long does this roast take on average for a say an 8 lb roast? Just got my clay pot and I want to try this for Xmas this year, but don't want to mess up and need to know a ballpark time to plan dinner! This will be my first attempt at a rib roast.

Growing up with a chef dad, I never thought I'd be able to top his holiday roast. That belief was shattered when I served this roast last year. My family is still talking about how delicious and flavorful it was.
Prep time - if you have limited fridge space, it may be a bit inconvenient.
Digital probe thermometer - the one I have is good in terms of functionality, but can be technically challenging. Just make sure you take the time to read the directions over before delving into the project. If you do not have this set properly, it will mean the end of your meal.
<p> Awesome12/18/2005 at 08:13pmUser:Vince from New York, NYUser Rating:
I used a 2 rib roast instead of a 4 rib. I think b/c the roast was smaller, it didn't carry over as much heat. I took the roast out at 118 degrees, but it only carried over to 125. Next time I use a smaller roast, I'll probably let it go to about 123 degrees before taking it out of the oven.
I also used a roast that was already dry aged (can't beat the NYC butcher shops), so not too much moisture came out of it in the fridge.
All in all - outstanding...even without the flower pot. Probe therometer is a must!

You may need to adjust the temps though. Instead of pulling out the roast at 118 I pulled it out at 125 and it only heated to 129 and stopped. I blasted at 500 for about 18 minutes. When I took it out I took the temperature and it got up to 150. The center cuts were pretty rare. I liked it that way but next time I'll keep it in the oven at 200 until it gets up to 130 degrees. I made the Au Juise and it was great I also used the fat to make Yorkshire Pudding which was a great side dish for this meal. Then I used the bones and made beef soup. Today I had a prime rib sandwich on an onion roll for lunch. This cut of meat may be expensive but I was able to make so many things out of. Best of all the kids asked for thirds!!

When using this recipe, don't skimp on using a lower and cheaper cut, as it will taste this way in the end. Also using a GOOD RED wine makes all the difference in the world when it comes to the Au Jus.
I have to say that this is probably the best prime rib recipe that I have found, and have passed this on the several friends who loved it.

Absolutely a fantastic recipe. The best rib roast I've ever had, including some top notch steakhouses. A few things to consider, though. Firstly, the clay pot is not strictly necessary, but the even heat from all sides ensures the meat all gets done at the same time. This is the real strength of this recipe...uniform doneness all the way through, top to bottom, side to side. In higher temp recipes, the outer ring of filet meat(which is the best part) is always way overdone. With this recipe it was perfectly medium rare with a small 1/4 inch layer that was more done from the browning process.
Be warned, though, carry-over temp varies with the size of the roast. The smaller it is, the less it will carry over.

I have made this at least 6 times now and it comes out perfect everytime. I actually bought a terra cotta planter and base that just fits in my oven to cook it. It is a pain, but it makes the best roast. I have adjusted the cooking times a bit because we live in a high altitude area. This is the meal my dad asks for when it is birthday, anniversary and any time he can get me to make it for him. Just add sweet creamed corn, scallopped potatoes and asparagus and you are set.

Meat was delicious!
It does take some planning and time to cook, but well worth the trouble.
We have made it twice and now is a family tradition!
Thanks!

I was scared to leave the high priced meat open in the fidge to dry age, but patience eliminated my fear.
Caution with the high heat at the end of this cooking. Any "stuff in the oven will burn off and set off the smoke detector. ( A great opportunity to have a family fire drill and a great meal afterwards.) You must try this recipe.

It's worth the investment in time to age the roast.

INDEED THESE WERE GREAT GOOD EATS! ?WORTH THE TIME TO PREPARE. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE GOING TO SERVE THIS FOR A DINNER PARTY ASK AB FOR SOME CORRELATION BETWEEN POUNDS OF MEAT TO TIME TO SERVE, ELSE THE ACCOMPANIMENTS, AND GUESTS, MAY GET COLD OR OVERDONE BEFORE THE BEEF IS DONE.

This is a great recipe. It is easy and has quickly become a family favorite. The low heat cooking method results in a very evenly cooked roast. Wonderful if you love your roast beef rare.
Don't be scared off by the "Terra Cotta pot". It makes sense if you have seen the show (remember this is Alton Brown). It works very well in a pyrex dish covered with foil.
I have had somewhat inconsistant results with the au jus. It can be a little salty from all the salt on the roast. It depends how much falls into the pan during the cooking process. I have also "exploded" a pyrex dish on my range while deglazing. Ooops. Make sure you heat it evenly.

Follow the rest of the drill...I've done a couple of 4-ribs and a 7-rib. Same drill for all sizes, shapes.
It may be the best rib roast you've had in your entire life...it will be medium rare-ish, though, deal with it...age it for 4-6 days if you can. It gets funky looking, but you will not believe the whole dang thing when you taste it. You will finally understand WHY you have taste buds. The sage au jus is easy/excellent.

I didn't have a clay pot, but the rib roast still turned out great. I also cooked a cheap pork roast in the same manner (low, then high) and it was even more popular than the roast. Go figure. Like some of the other reviews, a better time estimate would've been helpful, but I was real lucky and both roasts were perfect doneness
<p> Christmas Rib Roast03/03/2005 at 11:50amUser:ANDREW from mn, MNUser Rating:
This is a fantastic recipe for cooking a great holiday meal. It is now a tradition for our family to buy a good sized rib roast (we go with a six bone roast) and to cook this with a whole smattering of side dishes. The meat is always flavorful and tender. It has a slightly peppery and salty quality that pervades the whole roast, but not enough to alter the natural flavor of the meat, just to draw out it's inherent flavors. The roast comes out with a nice medium well slice on either end of the roast and succulent rare slices in the center, truly a phenomenal thing for famlies that have differeing tastes on doneness. Excellent meal, bar none.

I never should doubt AB--this recipe is so incredible! The BEST roast ever! The dry aging made it so tender and sweet! I used an "ordinary" rib roast just in case, and it was superb! Cannot wait to try it w/a real prime piece of meat from the butcher! I did a beef broth reduction w/a touch of cognac for the au jus. And for a super horsey sauce: sour cream, horseradish and blue cheese crumbles! Thanks AB! I will never doubt you again! Brined turkey and aged rib roast ROCK!

The family raves about this and says that it's good, but I just don't care for it... or it seems like it never comes out looking as good as AB's in the show. Plus I have problems with the temp coming up right. I timed Christmas dinner wrong and had to dramatically raise the temperature at the end to eat before midnight. But, everyone raves about it, so 4 stars.

The standing rib roast was USDA choice, and this technique produced a gorgeous, perfectly medium rare throughout, the most flavorful beef ever, from anywhere, anytime, with any grade of beef. Dry aging in the 'fridge in no problem whatsoever. Yes, I'm just a little enthusiastic. Thank you, AB.

As a chef I am always looking for something new. I thought this recepie
sounded great but I found the end result to be a little tough. I mean it
was ok but nothing special. I followed the recepi exactly and used a cut of
black angus choice. The meat looked great when finish, pink though-out but was a little chewy. I have always learned with expensive cuts of meat you need to use higher heat.
<p> Good Taste Takes a lot longer01/16/2006 at 12:39pmUser:Andrew from Lincoln, NEUser Rating:
I have wanted to try this for some time now and finally did. Couldnt find the planter as most stores around here dont carry that thing in winter. Anyway I only had time to dry age for a little over 2 days. You have to be trusting as the meat starts to look scary. When it was finally time to cook I let it stand out for about an hour and a half (something they always talk about but didnt have in the recipe). Put in the oven @ 200 and waited.... and waited.. and waited. I think it must cook faster with the planter as it took about 5 hrs to hit 118. I pulled the meat out and it was so cool that the temp didnt rise at all. I put the roast back in at 225 and set the alarm for 125. This took about another hour to reach, much to the dismay of my now very hungry guests. Once this temp was reached I pulled the roast and covered, then started the wine reduction. This step takes longer than I thought (about 45 minutes), for something that, in my opinion, tastes very bad. I guess I dont like the taste of Sage, but everyone is different. When i cut the meat though, I was very pleased to find it very flavorful with great texture, and this is only 2 days dry aging, next time I will go the 3 days or more. Over all it was good but if you dont have the planter plan on about 6 to 7 hrs of cook/ prep time. Also I would take to roast to at least 120 or more the meat was still a nice mid rare and didnt coast to much over 130 (134 I think).

I actually cooked the meat completely differently (in a rotisserie), but used the aging process in this recipe. It turned out FABULOUS! I have a mortal, almost irrational fear of food contimination/poisoning, but if you stick to his temp/moisture guidlines, you'll be fine. I actually aged the beef for almost 5 days and it turned out perfect. Cooked perfectly through as well!

<p> Temps are on the rare side01/12/2005 at 10:18pmUser:DARREN from Salem, ORUser Rating:
I love good juicy pink beef, but the temps given on the show were a bit on the rare side. If you will have guests that like beef on the medium or done side add another ten degrees to what he recommends on the show. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was to absolutely die for but, my wife likes her beef "done" and even the outer cuts were not acceptable to her. It all depends on your guests however and this recipe absolutely kicks behind if you're a prime rib fan. Use the clay pot, it does make a difference with the crust at the end.

<p> Best ever Prime Rib!!!!!!!!01/11/2005 at 03:34pmUser:ROBIN from Henderson, NVUser Rating:
Christmas Day Dinner was looking a little bleak, we were all very tired of Turkey and Ham. So, I decided to try my favorite meal. Never having attemped to make a Standing Rib Roast, I was a little intimidated and cost factors also played a big part of my hesitance. But watching Alton do anything gives the confidence needed to proceed any task. I followed his instuction perfectly, however I could not locate the clay cover. I continued without it, and it turned out to be the BEST PRIME RIB ever!!!!
All of my family raved, we now have a new tradition. Not only did we enjoy the leftovers as French Dips, I made a chili using the bones and tiny bit left. If you are looking for the perfect recipe look no further... Thanks for this website, Robin LV NV

You would think that making a standing rib roast would be diffiuclt, but that was before Alton Brown, my hero. This is a wonderful recipe, the meat turns out delicious. I would advise measuring your oven before buying your pot and alllowing a minimum 4 hrs. cooking time at 200.

I was lucky enough to see the recipe featured on "Good Eats." I am so glad that I followed through with the online recipe. I paid carefull attention to detail: KOSHER salt, PROBE thermometer, and TERRA COTTA. My troubles we rewarded ten-fold. It was simply the best roast (or any piece of meat) I have EVER cooked! Thank you Mr.Brown &amp; Food network for a great holiday meal.

I've had horrible results with standing rib roasts several times in the past and was largely discouraged by the tough and fatty results and the total waste of money. On pure faith in dear Alton I tried it again this year. I purchased a grocery-store choice cut of meat (to minimize my losses if it was another bomb--faith only goes so far). My local Home Depot supplied the appropriate pottery, and my cooler drawer in my fridge did the aging. (I was nervous, afraid I'd end up with a rotten piece of meat.)
Let me tell you, this roast rivaled the local 4-star restaurants. Alton, you are wonderful! And to the person who asked if the pottery is necessary because it's inconvenient: yes, it's necessary, and if you want convenience you can get pre-cooked rib roast slices at your local Costco!

I was horrified to try the aging after what I paid for the roast (fear of rotting), but it was just fine. I didn't use the clay pot as the oven didn't need it. The wonderful part is that it was the same pink color from the outside in, and every slice looked better than the one previous. This was simply grand!

I found the reviews extremely helpfull. the mistake I made was in not knowing temps and doneness. I went for 147 degrees and wound up with well done. I also could not get the meat temp. to rise out of the oven. I recommend not waiting more than 20 minutes and then placing back in the oven at the 500 degree setting until hitting the temp and doneness that you like. I also enjoyed and endorse the link to Emeralds Horseradish sauce. My family loved it. I also like Alton's idea of saving the bones for a late night snake for the Cook
