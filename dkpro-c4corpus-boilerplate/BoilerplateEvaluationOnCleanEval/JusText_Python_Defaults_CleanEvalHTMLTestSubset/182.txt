<p> An increasing number of countries require that foreigners be tested for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prior to entry.
It is usually required as part of a medical exam for long-term visitors, i.e. students and workers. The following list of
country requirements is based on information available as of March 2006 and is subject to change. Before traveling abroad,
check with the embassy of the country to be visited to learn about entry requirements and specifically whether AIDS testing
is a requirement. If the list indicates U.S. test results are acceptable and the word “Yes” appears with an asterisk beside
it (Yes*) in a particular country, prospective travelers should inquire at the embassy of that country for details (e.g.
which laboratories in the United States may perform tests and where to have results certified and authenticated) before departing
the United States.
