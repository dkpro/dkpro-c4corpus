As you carefully squat down and try to relax a snake suddenly comes slithering through the weeds and startles you. What a mess! Now when nature calls you can go in comfort where ever you are with the one and only Bumper Dumper � .

Has this happened to you? You're driving on a long secluded stretch of road. You and the family had a big dinner at the last restaurant about an hour ago and someone's gotta go. "Can you hold it till the next stop", you ask. You drive a few miles and the sign says next station 90 miles ahead. Meanwhile, she tells you she needs to go too, but she can wait till the next stop. You keep driving a while and find yourself starting to feel the urge as well. By this time everyone is getting pretty anxious. You finally see the exit to the station and the brain kicks in. Everyone knows it's almost time for relief. You quickly exit and pull in to park. You get the restroom key from the attendant and hurry to open the door.
