Tennessee: Open Carry in Tennessee???
Does anyone know the open carry status in Tennessee? I'll be travelling there from NC at the end of this week. Also, what about car carry?

Cannot carry with "the intent to go armed" Added by ICP_juggalo on 2002-01-14 @ 00:21:11
From what I understand about the law in TN, you cannot carry on your person or loaded in your car a pistol or any other loaded firearm. If you carry a loaded pistol on your person or in your car, it is defined by law a "carry with the intent to go armed" and is illegal unless you have a license to carry. So I would carry unloaded in a case and seperated from the ammunition. -ICPjuggalo

General Questions on Concealed Firearm Laws Q: Why are "Concealed Carry Badges" frowned upon by most non-newbie ccw license permit holders and police? A: Because badges are a symbol of authority, they are easily misinterpreted as law enforcement badges, which for a non LEO is a bad thing. Concealed carry licences/permits give no authority, rather, only the permission to carry a concealed weapon. If the state, city, county, or town wanted to issue CCW permits/licences in the form of a badge, they would do so. If you want a badge, join a law enforcement agency or a fire department...their badges are usually quite pretty.
