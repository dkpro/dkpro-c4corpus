<h1>ANEMIA OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>1. Symptoms of
anemia include fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and even angina. Physical
exam findings include pallor, tachycardia, and jaundice.</p>
<p>2. To generate a differential diagnosis 
anemia, first categorize the type of anemia (microcytic, normocytic,
macrocytic) by MCV and furthermore with the ferritin and reticulocyte
count. Then, exam the peripheral smear: findings on the smear will narrow
your differential, suggest additional medical problems the patient may have ( i.e. 
target cells and liver disease, spur cells and uremia with uremic platelet
dysfunction), and may reveal diagnoses such as microangiopathic hemolytic
anemia (MAHA) in a timely fashion. Finally, order additional tests to
confirm your diagnosis and remember to get your tests before transfusing the
patient.</p>
<p>3. Factoids:</p>
<p>· Hospitalized patients will drop their
hematocrit 1% per day from blood draws.</p>
<p>· Epogen® causes hypertension if the
hematocrit is raised > 35% in ESRD and does not work in the setting of iron
deficiency.</p>
<p>· Follow the hemoglobin and not the
hematocrit. The hematocrit is calculated from two measured values and has a ± 3 point range for error.</p>
<h1>MICROCYTIC ANEMIA (MCV < 80)</h1>
<p>1. Work-up: order
iron, ferritin, transferrin, and if possible a red cell distribution width
(RDW).</p>
<p>2. Iron deficiency: On physical exam, look for koilonychia, atrophic tongue. 
Iron deficiency usually does not cause a microcytic anemia until the hematocrit
drops below 30%. Ferritin is useful for diagnosing iron deficiency. The
likelihood ratios are as follows: for a ferritin <15 the LR=50 in favor of
iron deficiency anemia; for a ferritin <25 the LR=10, specificity of 98%;
for a ferritin >100 the LR=0.1. Since ferritin is an acute phase reactant,
some say it should not be used in the setting of inflammation; others say that
in chronic inflammation a ferritin < 50 is highly suggestive of iron
deficiency. Iron is low and transferrin or TIBC (total iron binding
capacity) is high, which makes the transferrin saturation (iron divided by
transferrin) low: a saturation <10% has a specificity of 88%. The RDW
(reflecting anisocytosis) is high. Once you've made the diagnosis, rule out GI
bleeding: around 60% of patients will have GI lesions. Order stool guiaics, a
colonoscopy, and possibly an EGD. With treatment, the hematocrit should
be normal in 2 months; continue iron treatment 4-6 months to replete stores.
Common side effect of oral iron is constipation. IV iron available if
patient refractory to PO, but has increased risk of anaphylaxis. Each PRBC
transfused contains 200 mg elemental iron.</p>
<p>3. Sideroblastic anemia: hereditary cases are usually microcytic while acquired
sideroblastic anemia may be normocytic. Acquired causes include lead, INH,
EtOH, B 6 deficiency. Basophilic stippling and dimorphic RBC
morphology is seen on peripheral blood smear.</p>
<p>4. Thalassemia: 
The Mentzer index may be helpful: (MCV/RBC count) < 13 favors thalassemia
over iron deficiency. This test has a high sensitivity but low
specificity. Basically in iron deficiency, the marrow can't produce RBCs
and they're small so the RBC count will be low along with the MCV. In
thalassemia, RBC production is preserved, though the cells are small and
fragile. So the RBC count is normal with a low MCV. This concept
may be more helpful than remembering the Mentzer index. The RDW in
thalassemia, unlike iron deficiency, is normal and may be a more accurate
discriminant function in differentiating between the two. Make the
diagnosis of beta-thalassemia with hemoglobin electrophoresis.
Alpha-thalassemia will not show up on electrophoresis: it is diagnosed by
molecular diagnostic techniques. Order an "A-thal" on the lab slip. Think of A lpha
thalassemia in A sians. Beta thal in Meditteraneans. 
Differential diagnosis for target cells on smear: beta thalassemia, hemoglobin
C disease, liver disease, beta-lipoproteinemia. In general you should not
see targets in sickle cell unless they are sickle-thalassemia or sickle-C.</p>
<p>5. Anemia of chronic disease: Chronic inflammatory diseases, that is, such as cancer and
collagen-vascular diseases. Transferrin is decreased, saturation increased,
iron low, ferritin normally increased (non specific for chronic disease). The
MCV rarely falls below 78, though the patient can become microcytic because
they are functionally deficient of iron.</p>

<h1>NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA (MCV 80-100)</h1>
<p>1. Reticulocytes:</p>
<li>First check a reticulocyte count. Your goal is to come up with a reticulocyte index (RI).</li>
<li>If your lab gives you an absolute 
reticulocyte count, make into a percent reticulocyte count by
dividing by the RBC count. Make sure to convert your units!</li>
<li>Now correct the reticulocyte count for the patient's hematocrit (HCT). Corrected reticulocyte count = % reticulocytes x (actual hematocrit ¸ ideal
hematocrit).</li>
<li>Now correct for early release of reticulocytes by dividing by (1 + 0.5 x ) where x is 1 for every drop of 10% in
the hematocrit. For example, divide by 1.5 for HCT=35% and divide by
2 for HCT=25%.</li>
<li>You now have the reticulocyte index (RI). If the RI < 2 for HCT 10-35%, or < 3 for HCT < 10%, your patient has a hypoproliferative anemia.</li>
<p>2. Decreased reticulocyte count:</p>
<p>· Primary bone marrow failure:</p>
<p>- Aplastic anemia/red cell aplasia : diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy.</p>
<p>- Myelophthisis : (replacement of the bone marrow) tear
drops on smear</p>
<p>- Myelodysplastic syndrome</p>
<p>· Secondary bone marrow failure:</p>
<p>- Anemia of chronic disease : Normal or increased platelets and WBCs
support this is the diagnosis.</p>
<p>- Iron, B12, folate deficiency (nutritional
deficiency)</p>
<p>- Chronic kidney disease : use erythropoeitin when the creatinine
clearance drops below 30 ml/min.</p>
<p>- Hypersplenism : usually anemia is concomitant with mild
pancytopenia.</p>
<p>- Hypothyroidism : especially in the elderly</p>
<p>- Multiple myeloma : check SPEP, UPEP</p>
<p>- HIV/AIDS</p>
<p>- Mixed: e.g. an alcoholic with megaloblastic anemia
from folate deficiency, and iron deficiency from GI bleeding. The MCV is
normal, but the RDW is increased reflecting anisocytosis (cells of varying
sizes).</p>
<p>4. Increased reticulocyte count : check smear for schistocytes (intravascular hemolysis)
and/or spherocytes (extravascular hemolysis).</p>
<p>· Acute blood loss : If you can't find a source, don't forget
to rule out occult retroperitoneal bleed.</p>
<p>· Correction : of a production deficit. Peak MCV at
7-10 days.</p>
<p>· Hemolysis : see below.</p>
<p>5. Hemolysis:</p>
<li>Classification is based on:</li>
<p>- Site of hemolysis
(intravascular vs. extravascular) or</p>
<p>- Intrinsic (RBC defect) vs. an
acquired extrinsic mechanism (where transfused cells will have a shortened life
span).</p>
<p>- Send LDH, total and direct bilirubin,
and possibly haptoglobin (level < 25 is 96% specific for hemolysis). A
normal LDH and haptoglobin > 25 helped rule out hemolysis in one small
study. Haptoglobin overall is not very useful as it takes one week to
return, is an acute phase reactant, and is very sensitive (leading to
decreased specificity).</p>
<li>Intravascular causes: red cell fragmentation syndromes, PNH, immediate transfusion reactions. Look for schistocytes and urine hemoglobin/hemosiderin/heme+ (sensitive).</li>
<li>Extravascular causes: RBCs destroyed by the reticuloendothelial system.</li>
<li>Extrinsic causes:</li>
<p>- Hypersplenism</p>
<p>- Antibody-mediated : warm (IgG) vs. cold (Ig M ) think M ono, M ycoplasma;check Coomb's. Spherocytes are on the smear. Drugs are a big
offender as well.</p>
<p>- Trauma/ Red Cell fragmentation : heart valve, hemodialysis, malignant
HTN, vasculitis, HELLP, cardiopulmonary bypass, TTP/HUS, DIC. Look for
schistocytes and helmet cells (even 1-2 per HPF), and spherocytes. Remember:
DIC increases INR and PTT, HUS and TTP do not.</p>
<p>- Infection/toxin: malaria, babesiosis, clostridia,
brown-recluse, copper (Wilson's disease).</p>
<p>· Intrinsic defects: all are hereditary
except PNH.</p>
<p>- Membrane: Hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary
elliptocytosis.</p>
<p>- Enzyme: e.g. G6PD deficiency: normal smear and
Coomb's. Check G6PD levels, which may be normal after an acute hemolytic
episode or post transfusion. Consider this in HIV patients, particularly
African Americans, taking PCP prophylaxis. Although this is X-linked recessive,
it may still occur in females due to lyonization.</p>
<p>- Hemoglobinopathy: sickle cell, thalassemias, Hgb C, Hgb E.</p>
<p>- PNH : complement-mediated lysis. Consider with pancytopenia, unexplained
thrombosis (especially intra-abdominal) and an elevated reticulocyte count and
LDH. A rare diagnosis.</p>

<p>JAMA. 1980 May 16;243(19):1909-11.</p>
<h1>MACROCYTIC ANEMIA (MCV > 100)</h1>
<p>1. Megaloblastic :
hypersegmented neutrophils (> 5% of neutrophils with 5 lobes or > 1% with
6 lobes) are seen on the smear. An MCV > 120 is almost pathognomonic for
megaloblastic anemia. Ovalocytes may be seen, but are nonspecific. On physical
exam, look for atrophic tongue.</p>
<p>· B12 deficiency : diagnose with serum B12. This value may
be falsely decreased secondary to folate deficiency or type 1 cryoglobulinemia
( e.g. multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia). Look for
subacute combined degeneration. Can send homocysteine and methylmalonic
acid. Schilling test to look at source of deficiency. May have
pancytopenia.</p>
<p>· Folate deficiency : diagnose with RBC-Folate level. 
(Serum folate fluctuates and is a poor proxy for folate stores). May be
falsely low secondary to B12 deficiency.</p>
<p>· Drug-induced : chemo, methotrexate (MTX), hydroxyurea,
azathioprine, etc.</p>
<p>· Note: repletion of vitamin B12 should
always accompany folate and iron therapy until you are sure the patient does
not have multiple deficiencies, in order to avoid aplastic-type crisis and/or
high output CHF. In addition, folate may partially correct the
megaloblastic anemia of B12 deficiency while the neurologic symptoms progress.</p>
<p>2. Non-megaloblastic : MCV < 110 in most cases.</p>
<p>· Alcoholism : most common cause of macrocytic anemia.</p>
<p>· Hypothyroidism</p>
<p>· Reticulocytosis : although the reticulocyte MCV is 160 microns, reticulocytosis rarely
causes an MCV above 110. Polychromasia is seen on smear.</p>
<p>· Spurious : hyperglycemia and hypernatremia, secondary to osmotic swelling.</p>
<p>· Aplastic anemia</p>
<p>· Myelodysplastic syndromes : giant platelets, hypogranulated neutrophils, bi-lobed
neutrophils.</p>

<h1>DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS</h1>
<p>2. Over 9 in 10 pulmonary emboli originate
from DVTs, and the treatment of PE and DVT are usually identical.</p>
<p>3. DVTs are associated with calf pain and
tenderness. Homan's sign-pain when dorsiflexing the foot with the knee
extended-is neither sensitive nor specific and should be abandoned.</p>
<p>4. DVT prophylaxis should be addressed in
all inpatients. Encourage early ambulation and order physical therapy when
indicated. Obtain prophylaxis with sequential compression devices, low dose ultrafractionated
heparin, or low molecular weight heparin ( e.g. enoxaparin). See
also Medical Consultation:
DVT/PE prophylaxis .</p>
<p>5. Simple clinical model to diagnose DVT:</p>
<p>· Give the patient one (1) point for each of the following (if they
are present): active cancer, immobilization, bedridden > than 3 days due to
surgery, localized tenderness, entire leg swelling, asymmetric > 3 cm calf
swelling, pitting edema, or collateral superficial veins (nonvaricose).</p>
<li>Is there an alternative diagnosis that is as likely or more likely than DVT? If yes, subtract 2 points.</li>
<li>Score > 3: high probability of DVT,
prevalence of DVT 75% .</li>
<li>Score 1-2: moderate probability of DVT,
prevalence of DVT 17% .</li>
<li>Score 0: low probability of DVT, prevalence of
3% .</li>
<p>6. Work-up of suspected DVT:</p>
<p>· D-dimers : very useful if your local hospital has the ELISA test
which is very sensitive (good for ruling out DVT). Some labs use the
latex agglutination test, which is only 85-90% sensitive. Thus, in a patient
with a non-diagnostic V/Q scan (for PE) or Doppler ultrasound (for DVT), a
negative D-dimer (ELISA method) means it is probably safe not to anticoagulate
if your clinical suspicion is low or moderate.</p>
<p>· Doppler ultrasound : This test is better at detecting DVTs above
the knee (which, in fact, are the clinically significant ones as clots below
the knee rarely cause pulmonary embolism). Ultrasound is 50% sensitive in
an asymptomatic individual, and therefore cannot be used to rule out PE.
Ultrasound is also less sensitive than venogram for calf DVT.</p>
<p>7. Hypercoagulability work-up:</p>
<li>After the first event, the hypercoaguable work-up will lead to an etiology in only 30% of patients; after the second DVT only 50% will eventually have an etiology determined. Moreover, only 10-20% of people with an idiopathic DVT will ever have another event.</li>
<p>· It is not necessary to begin the work up
of anticoagulation at the time of the clot: the results won't change your
management and will take a while to come back anyway; therefore, consider an
outpatient work-up.</p>
<p>· Guidelines for hypercoagulability work-up:</p>
<p>- Draw an extra blue top tube before
starting heparin or warfarin if you suspect a hypercoaguable state: heparin
will interfere with assays for antithrombin III and the lupus anticoagulant.</p>
<p>- Protein C, S, anticardiolipin antibodies,
homocysteine, prothrombin 20210A, Factor V Leiden, and MTHFR mutations (leading
to hyperhomocysteinemia) can be sent when patients are taking heparin. Note
that Proteins C and S are vitamin K dependent factors and will be lowered by
warfarin therapy.</p>
<p>- AT III, Protein C, and Protein S may be
transiently depressed during the acute event, and only persistent lupus
anticoagulants are associated with hypercoagulability. Therefore, repeat
abnormal tests later to make an accurate diagnosis.</p>
<p>- Note that there is not a consensus that
all patients with unprovoked DVT/PE should have a hypercoagulability
work-up. The most common defects are not associated with recurrent
disease, and the ones that are, are uncommon. A targeted work-up is
likely a more reasonable approach ( e.g. send antiphospholipid antibody
as persistent lupus anticoagulant is associated with venous/arterial recurrence
and may require a higher INR goal for warfarin therapy).</p>
<p>8. Treatment : typically involves heparin (or enoxaparin) and
warfarin. Some advocate giving patients heparin for 5 days, even if their
INR becomes therapeutic in less than 5 days. Patients should be therapeutically
anticoagulated as soon as possible (within 24 hours). Thus, it is better to
overshoot and risk bleeding than to undershoot and risk further
embolic/thrombotic events. See Hematology/Oncology:
Heparin and Hematology/Oncology: Warfarin

<h1>HEPARIN</h1>
<h3>1. Risk factors for bleeding while on
heparin:</h3>
<p>· Surgery, trauma, or stroke within the
previous 14 days.</p>
<p>· History of peptic ulcer disease, GI
bleeding or GU bleeding.</p>
<p>· Platelets < 150K.</p>
<p>· Age > 70 years.</p>
<p>· Hepatic failure, uremia, bleeding
diathesis, brain metastases.</p>
<p>2. When to use low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin): LMWH eliminates the need to
monitor PTT and adjust dosages. You may send selected patients home with
enoxaparin and warfarin, rather than keeping them in-house on heparin for 5
days or until they are therapeutic on warfarin (see Hematology/Oncology: Outpatient therapy for
venous thromboembolism ). Moreover, LMWH is associated with a
lower incidence of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia. Regular,
ultrafractionated heparin is preferable when:</p>
<li>Patients require prolonged hospitalization anyway (cost savings over enoxaparin) or</li>
<li>Rapid reversal of anticoagulation might be necessary ( e.g. possible surgery).</li>
<p>3. Consider a hematology consult before using LMWH in the following
situations:</p>
<p>· Weight > 150 kg.</p>
<p>· Creatinine > 2, or creatinine clearance
< 30 ml/min.</p>
<p>· Pregnancy.</p>
<p>4. For heparin sliding scale, see Sliding Scales: Heparin .</p>

<h1>WARFARIN</h1>
<p>1. Give the warfarin on day one of heparin
or enoxaparin if long-term anticoagulation is desired. Usually 5.0-7.5 mg
PO at night (to ensure absorption on an empty stomach) on Day 1, then 2.5-7.5
mg PO QHS (most often 5 mg). Increase in the INR of > 0.3-0.4 units per day
should result in a dose reduction (otherwise an INR overshoot is likely).</p>
<p>2. Goal for INR:</p>
<li>An INR of 2.5-3.5 for mechanical prosthetic valves or recurrent systemic thromboembolism</li>
<li>INR of 2.0-3.0 for most others (uncomplicated DVT/PE).</li>
<p>3. Information about the patient's past warfarin dosing history will
help you titrate appropriately. Congestive heart failure, liver disease,
vitamin K deficiency and certain medications influence warfarin response.
Tailor the duration of warfarin therapy to the individual and the indication -
usually three months to life.</p>

<h1>OUTPATIENT
THERAPY FOR VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM</h1>
<p>· Clinically stable patients with DVT or PE
documented with imaging study.</p>
<p>· Patients must be motivated and interested
in home self-injection and frequent follow-up.</p>
<p>· Co-morbid conditions: Active peptic ulcer
disease, bleeding in last 14 days, brain metastases, CVA in last 10 days,
blindness, CNS or cord injury/surgery in last 10 days, family bleeding diathesis,
patient weight <35 kg, platelets < 80K or fall of > 40%.</p>
<p>· Anesthesia: Spinal or epidural anesthesia
in past 3 days.</p>
<p>· Medication conflicts: prior sensitivity to
heparin, concomitant thrombolytic therapy, need for high-dose NSAIDs other than
ibuprofen, naproxen, or Celebrex®. Vioxx® may result in warfarin
sensitivity.</p>
<p>· Cognition problems: inability to maintain
diary, inject medications, reliably follow medication schedules, recognize change
in health status, or understand directions from home health team.</p>
<p>3. Initial therapy: enoxaparin (1 mg/kg SQ q12h) plus warfarin (5 mg PO qhs; 7.5 mg PO
qhs if > 85 kg).</p>
<p>4. Maintenance algorithm:</p>
<p>· Continue enoxaparin until patient has
received five days of enoxaparin and has two consecutive INR > 2.0.</p>
<p>· Adjust warfarin to keep INR in desired
range.</p>
<p>· Check PT/INR frequently after day 2 until
patient is on stable dose of warfarin.</p>
<h1>SUPRATHERAPEUTIC PT/PTT</h1>
<p>1. Differential diagnosis for prolonged PT: warfarin, liver disease, poor nutrition,
vitamin K deficiency (antibiotics, nutritional, fat malabsorption), deficiency
or inhibitor for factors II, V, VII, or X, DIC, heparin bolus.</p>
<p>2. Differential diagnosis for prolonged PTT: heparin, congenital deficiency of VIII,
IX, XI, von Willebrand's disease, anti-phospholipid antibody, inhibitor to any
factor except VII, liver disease, DIC.</p>
<p>3. Use oral vitamin K to correct mild to moderate PT prolongation.
Correction occurs within 10-12 hours. Subcutaneous vitamin K is as good as IV
vitamin K, minus the risk of anaphylaxis.</p>
<p>4. FFP lasts 4-6 hours (need to give concomitant vitamin K).</p>
<p>5. Bebulin is a plasma-derived concentrate of factors II, VII, IX,
and X. It should be used in life threatening bleeds associated with
warfarin. Dose Bebulin ~50 U/kg IV push (need to give concomitant vitamin
K).</p>
<p>6. For heparin associated bleeding:</p>
<p>· Unfractionated heparin: Protamine 1 mg for
every 100 units heparin given. Dose by adding the amount given during each
prior hour divided by 2 number of hours back . For example, a
patient on a heparin drip at 500 units/hour for 3 hours (without a bolus) would
have approximately (500/2 0 )+(500/2 1 )+(500/2 2 )
= 500 + (500/2) + (500/4) = 875 units of circulating heparin. 
Therfore, the patient should be given 8-9 mg of protamine.</p>
<p>· Enoxaparin: 1mg:1mg. Protamine may reverse 40-50% of the drug effect.</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>SC: 10 mg</p>
<p>10 - 20 cc/kg</p>
<h1>UREMIC BLEEDING</h1>
<p>1. Tips:</p>
<p>· Keep hematocrit > 24%</p>
<p>· Keep platelets > 75K</p>
<p>· FFP may be helpful if bleeding occurs in
the setting of an elevated INR</p>
<p>2. Therapies:</p>
<p>· Dialysis</p>
<p>· Conjugated estrogen 0.6 mg/kg IV QD x 5
days</p>
<p>· DDAVP 0.3 mcg/kg IV q12 hours x 2</p>
<h1>BLOOD PRODUCTS - COMPONENTS</h1>
<p>1. Premeds: 
consider pre-medicating with Benadryl 25 mg PO/IV and Tylenol 650 mg PO/PR
before each unit.</p>
<p>2. Packed red blood cells (PRBC):</p>
<p>· Most plasma removed. One unit should raise the hematocrit by 3
points or hemoglobin by 1 g/dL.</p>
<p>· Leuko-poor/leuko-filtered red blood cells have most
WBCs removed to make it less antigenic. Use in patients prone to transfusion
reactions and in patients requiring multiple transfusions (bone marrow
transplant, leukemia, chemotherapy).</p>
<p>· Washed red blood cells have WBC almost all
removed. Use as for leuko-poor RBC; note that they are more expensive. 
Used for patients with allergic reaction to transfusions.</p>
<p>· Irradiated blood cells have lymphocytes killed, decreasing
likelihood of graft-versus host disease (GVHD) in bone marrow transplant
patients.</p>
<p>· CMV
negative blood used for patients who are CMV negative and are pre-transplant or
post-transplant.</p>
<p>3. Platelets:</p>
<p>· A 6-pack should ideally raise
platelet count by 50-60K; For dysfunctional platelets (e.g. in uremia), DDAVP
is usually given at 0.3 mcg/kg IV q12-24 hours x 2. Do not correct platelets
for paracentesis.</p>
<p>· Indications:</p>
<p>- Platelets < 10-20K for non-bleeding
patient.</p>
<p>- Platelets < 50K for bleeding, pre-op,
or pre-procedure.</p>
<p>- Platelets < 75K for uremic bleeding
patients.</p>
<p>- Platelets < 100K for CNS or intraocular
bleed.</p>
<p>· Cross-matched platelets may be used when
patient has been sensitized to random-donor platelets and no longer bumps their
platelet counts after transfusion; cross-matching typically takes at least 1-2
days as well as lab medicine approval at most institutions.</p>
<p>· Always check a 1 hour post-transfusion
platelet count to ensure a response and to monitor for alloimmunization.</p>
<p>4. Fresh frozen plasma
(FFP):</p>
<p>· A
high PT is frequently encountered in end-stage liver disease. It is generally
okay to leave a high PT alone when a patient is not bleeding. For those with
refractory bleeding, use an FFP drip-the half-life of FFP is about 4-6 hours.</p>
<p>· FFP
is indicated if the PT > 18 seconds and is associated with bleeding or
planned procedures.</p>
<h2>5. Cryoprecipitate:</h2>
<p>· Contains factor VIII, von Willebrand
factor, and fibrinogen.</p>
<p>· Use
is generally reserved for patients with quantitative fibrinogen deficiency ( e.g. 
DIC) and qualitative fibrinogen deficits ( e.g. acquired dysfibrinogenemia
associated with liver disease). Its use in patients with hemophilia A (factor
VIII deficiency) and von Willebrand disease has been supplanted by the use of
specific factor products that are safer and more efficacious.</p>
<p>· Advantage: you can replete with less
volume than FFP.</p>

<h1>BLOOD PRODUCTS - COMPLICATIONS</h1>
<p>1. Work-up: for
all transfusion reactions consider a workup for a hemolytic reaction: blood
cultures and hemolysis labs, including purple top for Coombs and red top for
repeat type and cross. The blood bank is required to investigate and will
help. The different types of reactions are listed below.</p>
<p>2. Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction:</p>
<p>· Preexisting anti-RBC antibodies in the
recipient hemolyze donated blood. Usually caused by ABO incompatibility due to
a clerical error. Fever and hypotension occur early in the transfusion; chills,
flank pain, and dyspnea may occur.</p>
<p>- Stop blood product immediately, as little
as 30 cc can be fatal.</p>
<p>- Provide hemodynamic and renal support.</p>
<p>- Maintain diuresis with IV fluids and
furosemide; consider alkalinization of urine with bicarbonate to prevent renal
failure. Watch K + , CK.</p>
<p>3. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction:</p>
<p>· An extravascular immune-mediated process
mediated by noncomplement-binding IgG. Ideally, the "screen" portion of the
type and screen will identified patients susceptible to this
complication. Fever, jaundice, and anemia occur 2 days to 2 weeks after
transfusion.</p>
<p>4. Anaphylaxis:</p>
<p>· This is different from an acute hemolytic
reaction. Interestingly, the reaction is not IgE mediated, but caused by
immune-complex activation of complement - by "anaphylatoxins." Symptoms
are anaphylactoid, occur early in transfusion, and include laryngeal edema.</p>
<p>- Stop the transfusion</p>
<p>- Give epinephrine and steroids</p>
<p>- Wash subsequent blood products, and avoid
FFP</p>
<p>5. Bacterial contamination:</p>
<p>· Look for endotoxemia-the onset of high
fever/shock within 4 hours of transfusion. Platelets are far more likely to be
contaminated with bacteria than blood, because they are stored are room
temperature.</p>
<p>6. Acute lung injury:</p>
<p>· i.e. "noncardiogenic pulmonary edema". Also termed
"TRALI"-transfusion-related acute lung injury. This is caused by donor
antibodies against recipient WBCs. Respiratory failure occurs within 6 hours of
transfusion and treatment is supportive.</p>
<p>7. Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction:</p>
<p>· This is characterized by fever > 1 ° C during or within 2 hours of completing
transfusion. It occurs with 1 in 5 platelet transfusion reactions and is of
limited clinical significance. It is questionable whether it is necessary to
discontinue the transfusion. Caused by antibodies against foreign donor
leukocyte antigens.</p>
<p>8. Urticarial reaction:</p>
<p>· Some say it is okay to continue
transfusion if the patient responds to antihistamines. Again, this is different
from-and does not progress to-an anaphylactiod reaction.</p>
<p>· For nonhemolytic reactions:</p>
<p>- Benadryl 25-50 mg and Tylenol 650 mg for
mild transfusion reactions.</p>
<p>- Hydrocortisone 50-100 mg IV for moderate
and severe reactions.</p>
<h1>NEUTROPENIC FEVER: ABSOLUTE NEUTROPHIL
COUNT < 500</h1>
<p>· Obtain blood culture x 2, urine culture,
sputum Gram stain and culture, C. difficile toxin if patient has been on
antibiotics, and CXR.</p>
<p>· Order neutropenic precautions (no rectals,
no flowers, no fruit), neutropenic diet, mouth care with Peridex 10 cc sw/sp
bid, Nystatin 10 cc sw/sw qid or Mycelex troche 1 qid, and Tylenol 650 mg q 4-6
hour prn.</p>
<p>· Consider monotherapy with broad-spectrum
antibiotics such as ceftazidime, cefipime or anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam.
Cover for Gram negative bacteria including Pseudomonas. Also cover Gram
positives such as Staph aureus and Strep viridans.</p>
<p>- If prolonged neutropenia, consider fungal
infection and adding amphotericin B (typically 1 mg/kg IV qd).</p>
<p>- For nosocomial acquisition, suspected IV
catheter infection, known colonization with MRSA/PRSP, (+) blood culture for
Gram positive cocci, or a hypotensive patient, consider covering MRSA by adding
vancomycin.</p>
<p>- Double-cover documented Pseudomonas by
adding an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin. The
fluoroquinolone is preferable given the renal toxicity of aminoglycosides.</p>
<h6>3. Bone marrow transplant patients: the guidelines above still apply, except for the following:</h6>
<h6>· Most hospitals
that have a bone marrow transplant unit have an antibiotic algorithm that you
should follow when treating bone marrow transplant patients with neutropenic
fever.</h6>
<h6>· The patients most likely
to suffer from full blown sepsis syndrome are those who are
penicillin-allergic.</h6>
<h1>SICKLE CELL PAIN CRISIS</h1>
<p>Your hospital staff typically know these patients well. Often, the patient's primary physician has contracted with the patient for an individualized pain protocol. Consider consultation with the hematologist or pain service to get the exact details (if they exist). Don't be surprised by massive opiate tolerance and the need to rapidly escalate the analgesia dose required for relief: remember, physicians typically under-treat pain. Unlike most opioids, such as morphine and oxycodone, codeine and hydrocodone have ceilings beyond which increasing doses will not result in increasing analgesia.</p>
<p>1. Tips:</p>
<p>· Stroke, MI, persistent priapism, or
intractable pain characterize acute vaso-occlusive crises. Exchange transfusion
is indicated in these cases. Also, multi-organ failure requires urgent exchange
transfusion.</p>
<p>· If patient with frequent episodes of pain
crisis, consider hydroxyurea as prophylaxis.</p>
<li>In the past, the dogma for treating sickle cell crises called for aggressive fluids, oxygen, and even bicarbonate infusions as methods to reverse the "sickling" process in the red blood cells. However, we have since learned that the event that led to the sickle crisis (and thus the "sickling") has already occurred by the time the patient comes into the ER. Therefore, these measures are unlikely to be helpful and may be harmful (see below).</li>
<h4>2. Orders:</h4>
<p>· IV: moderate hypotonic ( e.g. D 5 ½NS )
hydration. Aggressive hydration can lead to or exacerbate acute chest
syndrome .</p>
<p>· DIET: NPO; advance diet as tolerated.</p>
<p>· NURSING: O 2 0-4 L/min by NC.
(If respiratory status is compromised, remember acute chest syndrome. A new
pulmonary infiltrate, fever, chest pain, cough, tachypnea and cough are
characteristic).</p>
<p>· LAB: CBC, reticulocyte count, cultures,
electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, bilirubin, U/A, CXR. Draw red-top tube for
type and hold. (If patient is to be transfused, alert the blood bank that the
patient has sickle cell disease; these patients will be screened more
thoroughly to avoid alloimmunization associated with frequent transfusions).</p>
<p>· MEDS:Folic acid 1 mg PO QD and analgesic du
jour. Avoid Demerol: these patients will inevitably require huge
doses, and are at greatly increased risk of seizures.</p>
<p>3. Try to determine precipitating factor(s): stress, dehydration,
drug use, infection, hypoxia, MI, etc. Although, remember that many of these
patients come in and out of the hospital for "routine" pain crises
without specific precipitants. While pain crises often present with
non-specific elevations in WBC and low-grade fevers, there always is the
potential for something bad to be going on. Therefore complete work up of
concomitant infection is important.</p>
<p>4. Acute chest syndrome: This is one of the dreaded complications of sickle cell disease
and a leading cause of death in adults with this disease. You should
think of this diagnosis in any patient with cough, chest pain, wheezing,
shortness of breath, fever, and/or new infiltrate on CXR who has a history of
sickle cell disease. Etiology is not fully known, but thought to involve
micro/macro vascular infarction, pulmonary fat emboli, and concurrent
viral/bacterial infection. Management primarily consists of supportive
care, bronchodilators, treatment of coexisting infection, and transfusions if
needed. In addition, a simple transfusion may be adequate, but if the
patient's clinical situation worsens an exchange transfusion may be needed.</p>

<h1>THROMBOCYTOPENIA</h1>
<p>1. Defined as
platelet count < 150K. Generally, platelets > 50K are not associated with
significant bleeding, and spontaneous bleeding rarely happens with platelets
>10-20K in the absence of coagulopathy or qualitative platelet defect.</p>
<p>· Avoid intramuscular injections, rectal
exams, suppositories, and enemas.</p>
<p>· Avoid drugs that interfere with platelet
function (e.g. NSAIDs/ASA, certain beta-lactam antibiotics).</p>
<p>2. History: 
"B"-symptoms (such as fevers, night sweats, weight loss), GI bleed, epistaxis.</p>
<p>3. Physical examination: look for lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, ecchymoses, petechiae,
purpura. Petechiae indicate a significant risk for intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<p>4. Labs: 
peripheral smear, PT/PTT, LDH (MAHA), BUN/Cr (HUS/TTP). Get HIV, ANA when
indicated, and consider toxoplasmosis, EBV, and CMV serology if
lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or "B"-symptoms are detected.</p>
<h6>5. Etiologies:</h6>
<h4>· Decreased Production</h4>
<p>- Aplastic anemia</p>
<p>- Megaloblastic anemia: B12 or folate
deficiency</p>
<p>- Hematologic malignancies: myelodysplasia,
leukemia, myeloma</p>
<p>- Marrow infiltration: lymphoma,
myelofibrosis, metastatic tumor, TB, Gaucher's disease</p>
<p>- Drug-induced: EtOH, thiazides, estrogens,
Septra, chemotherapy, cimetidine, famotidine</p>
<p>- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH):
rare and associated with pancytopenia.</p>
<p>- Infections: mono, influenza, rubella, hemorrhagic
fever, sepsis.</p>
<p>· Increased Destruction : classically associated with large
platelets on the smear.</p>
<p>- Immune mediated:</p>
<p>o ITP: sending platelet associated antibody
has low sens/spec, treat with steroids, IVIG, splenectomy</p>
<p>o Neoplasia-associated: CLL</p>
<p>o Drug-induced: quinidine, heparin (HIT),
rifampin, sulfa, indomethacin, gold</p>
<p>o SLE, RA</p>
<p>o HIV-associated thrombocytopenia</p>
<p>o Post-transfusion purpura</p>
<p>- Non-immune mediated:</p>
<p>o DIC: increased PT/PTT and D-dimers,
decreased platelet/fibrinogen, hemolytic anemia, prosthetic valves.</p>
<p>o HUS</p>
<p>o TTP: always increased LDH. Decreased
platelet, and normal PT/PTT.</p>
<h4>· Sequestration : Hypersplenism</h4>
<p>· Pseudo-thrombocytopenia :
Blood clumping on CBC, need to check smear to rule out</p>
<p>George JN, Raskob GE, et al. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia: a systematic review of published case reports.</p>
<h5>2. Diagnosis: think of this diagnosis in
your hospitalized patients whose platelet count starts dropping.</h5>
<h5>· You can diagnose HIT type 2 by
sending platelet factor 4 antibody, although this syndrome is primarily a
clinical diagnosis.</h5>
<h5>3. Incidence: HIT occurs less frequently now
with the increased use of low molecular weight heparin.</h5>
<h5>4. Complications: the thrombotic complications
can be arterial or venous and often occur at sites of preexisting pathology.</h5>
<h5>5. Treatment: includes stopping all heparin
products (including heparin flushes and coated catheters), and instituting
alternate anticoagulation, as these patients are at increased risk of
thrombosis. Choices include danaparoid (a heparinoid) or lepirudin and
argatroban (direct thrombin inhibitors).</h5>

<h1>ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES</h1>
<p>1. Cord compression: see Neurology:
Cord compression for more details. Remember early treatment is
key-dexamethasone, radiation, and neurosurgical evaluation.</p>
<p>2. Neutropenic fever: see Hematology/Oncology:
Neutropenic fever .</p>
<p>3. Cerebral metastases: can present as headache, seizures, altered mental
status, or focal deficit. Common in breast and lung cancer. 
Diagnose with head CT. Treat with dexamethasone, radiation, and possible
surgery. With edema, mass effect, and/or midline shift, consider measures
to control the rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) such as mannitol and
hyperventilation.</p>
<p>4. Carcinomatous meningitis: may present as seizures, focal neurologic deficits,
peripheral neuropathy, or altered mental status. Occurs most often with breast
cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia. Diagnose with spinal fluid
cytology. Treat with intrathecal chemotherapy or whole brain
radiation.</p>
<p>5. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome: presents with facial and/or upper extremity edema as well
as dyspnea on exertion. Commonly seen with lung cancer and
lymphoma. Diagnose with CT scan (gold standard). Treat with
radiation and/or chemotherapy based on tumor type. Surgery is often risky
and dangerous.</p>
<p>6. Hypercalcemia : Presents gradually with fatigue, anorexia,
constipation, polyuria, and confusion. Can occur with squamous cell
carcinomas, breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, and myeloma. Treat
with hydration, lasix, calcitonin and pamidronate if needed. See also Acid-base/Electrolytes: Hypercalcemia .</p>
<p>7. Tumor lysis syndrome: findings include ­ potassium, ­ phosphorous, ­ uric acid, ­ creatinine, and ¯ calcium. Often occurs with tumors that are bulky and very
chemotherapy-sensitive. Seen often in Burkitt's lymphoma. 
Prevent with hydration and allopurinol. If patient develops syndrome,
treat electrolyte abnormalities and continue hydration and allopurinol.</p>
<p>8. Hyperviscosity: patients present with nonspecific CNS symptoms such
as headache, dizziness, somnolence, and blurry vision. More often occurs
in patient with myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and polycythemia
vera. Obtain CSF, head CT to rule out other CNS processes. Treat
with hydration, phlebotomy (for polycythemia vera), and chemotherapy.</p>
<p>9. Leukostasis: occurs with very high white blood cell count in acute
leukemias. Symptoms include hypoxia, renal insufficiency, altered mental
status, and somnolence. Can worsen during induction chemotherapy. Obtain
CSF and head CT to rule out other diagnoses. Treat with leukopheresis,
hydration, induction chemotherapy, and possibly hydroxyurea. Avoid blood
product transfusions as this might worsen symptoms. Wait until after you
white blood cells have been removed by leukopheresis.</p>
<p>10. DIC: often
occurs in patients with AML (especially M 3 variant) and
adenocarcinoma patients. Diagnose by PT/PTT, fibrinogen, platelet count,
and D-dimers. Treat by correcting deficits-platelet transfusions, FFP,
vitamin K, cryoprecipitate. Treat the underlying cause. Heparin is
occasionally used to suppress the consumptive process, but the data on this is
limited.</p>
