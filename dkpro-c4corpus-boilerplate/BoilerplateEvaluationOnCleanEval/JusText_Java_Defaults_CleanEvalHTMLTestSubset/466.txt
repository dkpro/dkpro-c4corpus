Granny�s Garden School uses the school grounds to help kids discover the nature in their own back yards, experience the satisfaction of growing and preparing their own food and the simple pleasure of picking a flower.
We commend the Loveland school board, superintendent and principals for creating an environment where an organization such as ours could evolve. Their willingness to expand educational opportunities outside of the four walls of the traditional classroom make it possible to offer a unique learning opportunity to our students.
